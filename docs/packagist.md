# Content Build in Packagist
[Packagist](https://packagist.org/) is the main public package library, similar to NPM for Javascript or Gems for Ruby. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is used to manage PHP packages for a given application, similar to the `npm` or `gem` applications.

[Content Build is published to Packagist as a public package](https://packagist.org/packages/va-gov/content-build). This enables PHP applications to pull in Content Build via its Composer document as part of its build process.

## Updating Content Build on Packagist
