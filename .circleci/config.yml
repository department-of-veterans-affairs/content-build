        # Icon found

        Icons can be decorative, but sometimes they are used to convey meaning.
        If there are any semantics associated with an icon, those semantics
        should also be conveyed to a screen reader.

        ## What you can do

        Review the markup and see if the icon provides information that isn't
        represented textually, or wait for a VSP review.

        # Sentry call found
        Sentry captures a lot of data, and we want to make sure that we only
        keep information that will be useful for troubleshooting issues.  This
        means that PII should not be recorded.
        ## What you can do
        Review your call to Sentry and see if you can reasonably reduce any
        information that is included, or wait for a VSP review.
