        # Icon found

        Icons can be decorative, but sometimes they are used to convey meaning.
        If there are any semantics associated with an icon, those semantics
        should also be conveyed to a screen reader.

        ## What you can do

        Review the markup and see if the icon provides information that isn't
        represented textually, or wait for a VSP review.
