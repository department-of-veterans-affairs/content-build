<!--

This file is intentionally blank. It's here to prevent build errors.
The build looks for this file at some point because it matches the Drupal bundle type.
But the build actually uses health_care_region_locations_page.drupal.liquid to build VAMC locations pages instead.
It was easier to add this blank file than to figure out how to fix this issue.
