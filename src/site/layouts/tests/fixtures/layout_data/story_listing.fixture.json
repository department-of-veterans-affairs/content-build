          "processed": "<p>As the Veterans Health Administration celebrates its 75th anniversary this year, VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System reflects on the work of a determined social worker who is credited in great part with establishing its homeless Veterans program. The late Vincena “Vinnie” Malec paved the way for programs that go beyond clinical care to help Veterans whose problems are best solved without medicine.</p>\n\n<p>VA Pittsburgh’s <a href=\"https://www.va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care/homeless-veteran-care/\">homeless Veterans program</a> got its start in 1988 when Malec and her team partnered with the American Legion to provide housing for 10 homeless Veterans on Cypress Street in Coraopolis. From there, Malec tirelessly advocated for the establishment of VA Pittsburgh’s first Domiciliary Care Program until it opened in 1994 at the former Highland Drive campus.</p>\n\n<p>Malec died in 2015, but the Domiciliary, or Dom, and its programs live on. The Dom is now located in the Veterans Recovery Center (VRC) on the H.J. Heinz III campus in O’Hara Township.</p>\n\n<p>Those who knew <a href=\"https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/postgazette/obituary.aspx?n=vincena-malec-petruso&amp;pid=175556244&amp;fhid=9872\">Malec</a> said she put her heart into helping homeless Veterans. VA Pittsburgh social worker David Allen described Malec as a “real pioneer” who was very vocal in her support of programs for homeless Veterans.</p>\n\n<p>“She was a hard person to say no to,” said Allen, who has been on staff since the Dom first opened at Highland Drive.</p>\n\n<p>Lisa Fitzsimmons, VRC program manager, said Malec’s “persistence and consistency are why we have the program today.”</p>\n\n<p>Rich Deakin, a vocational rehabilitation specialist, said space was tight at the Dom’s original site on Highland Drive. Dormitory style rooms each had three beds. Veterans had access to two TV rooms. Clinical services were provided in a large room, with staff offices interspersed throughout each wing.</p>\n\n<p>As word of the Dom’s existence and its substance abuse program spread, VA medical facilities from throughout Pennsylvania – including Erie and Philadelphia – began to refer Veterans to the program. Veteran occupancy quickly maxed out at 50, said Allen.</p>\n\n<p>Veterans in the Dom program at Highland Drive traveled to University Drive for medical care as needed. An advantage to housing Veterans at Highland Drive was its recreational facilities.</p>\n\n<p>“The Dom Veterans got involved in community softball and basketball leagues, they had use of the gym, the swimming pool and the bowling alley,” Allen said.</p>\n\n<p>Buoyed by their newfound support, Veterans in the program worked hard to lift the stigma of homelessness.</p>\n\n<p>“The Veterans staged car washes with the staff and volunteered for an escort service where they would walk staff members to their cars at night,” said Allen. “That built a lot of trust between the Veterans and the community.”</p>\n\n<p>When it was announced the Highland Drive campus would close, VA Pittsburgh relocated the Dom to the Heinz campus in 2008.</p>\n\n<p>Gary Glacken, social worker, guided the Dom during the transition. Under Glacken’s direction, staff developed clinical programming, implemented state-of-the-art design features and established the Veterans Recovery Center. Deakin credits Glacken, who served as program manager from 1996-2010, for the Dom’s continued success today.</p>\n\n<p>“Gary took what Vinnie started and guided it to be the successful program it is now,” said Deakin.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike the condensed housing and recreational facilities at Highland Drive, the Heinz Dom is configured into homelike pods. The change helps Veterans learn independence and living skills. Some who enroll in the program, Fitzsimmons said, “only know the military where they’re told what to do, so they have to learn these skills.”</p>\n\n<p>In the 27 years since Malec succeeded in having the Dom established at VA Pittsburgh, the program has served 3,455 Veterans – and counting.</p>\n\n<p>“That’s a statistic that really helps tell our story,” said Allen.</p>\n\n<p>And a fitting legacy for Malec.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> If you are a Veteran who is homeless or know of a Veteran who is homeless, please call the <a href=\"https://www.va.gov/HOMELESS/NationalCallCenter.asp\">National Call Center for Homeless Veterans</a> at 877-4AID-VET (877-424-3838) for assistance.

She said every day is different, posing new challenges.</p>\n\n<p>“A lot of it depends on Sean’s feelings, so I have to shift and adapt to what he wants to do.”</p>\n\n<p>But Monahan knows Sean is a fighter.</p>\n\n<p>“He works harder than just about everyone I know,” Monahan said. “He’s very brave and has more in him than he realizes. He’s my hero as well as my friend.”</p>\n\n<p>With COVID-19 precautions in place, most VA caregiver classes at this time are virtual. They help caregivers learn ways to de-stress from the rigor of 24/7 caregiving and how to care not only for their Veterans, but also for themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Monahan enrolled in VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System’s Caregiver Program pre-pandemic and was able to take a number of in-person classes. She was exposed to new music genres, including types that help calm her. She learned yoga, qui gong, journaling and the benefits of a good diet. She learned mindfulness and meditation techniques she practices either alone or with Sean, and how to use a calming app to help her get to sleep at night.</p>\n\n<p>“A big thing they taught me about is depression and sadness and needing to accept help,” Monahan said.</p>\n\n<p>Monahan encourages other caregivers to try the program. Eligibility in the past year has expanded: it is now open to Veterans who were injured in the line of duty in the active military, naval or air service on or before May 7, 1975, including WWII, Korea and Vietnam Veterans.</p>\n\n<p> “There are so many resources there, it has really exploded now,” Monahan said. “No question is a dumb question; if you need to know, just ask.”</p>\n\n<p>Despite the pandemic, Sean has continued to participate in programs such as Guitars for Veterans and Project Healing Waters, which teaches Veterans how to make lures and fly fish. He and his mother also participate in equine therapy at STAT Ligonier Therapeutic Center with licensed therapists.  Sean even volunteers at STAT on Monday nights to help special needs children.</p>\n\n<p>Being around the horses is calming for mother and son. And for Holly, visiting the center provides a welcome break.</p>\n\n<p>“While it is a place for Sean, it has turned into a place for me to unwind and be in the moment,” said Monahan. “It is a magical place. The horses and other animals give me peace.”</p>\n\n<p>Holly said her advice for other caregivers is simple: don’t second guess yourself.</p>\n\n<p>“The choice you make at any given time is the best that you can do at that moment,” she said. “We need to give ourselves more credit for what we do.”</p>\n\n<p>If you are the caregiver for a Veteran and want more information on VA Pittsburgh’s caregiver program, call 412-822-2634 or visit <a href=\"https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.caregiver.va.gov%2F&amp;data=04%7C01%7C%7C9b7d9823d64448bc075308d92aa5adc4%7Ce95f1b23abaf45ee821db7ab251ab3bf%7C0%7C0%7C637587713333465168%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=g36K6fr9fOomgkMsMCfLGwIdQaJGz188%2FLOEh8g1T3A%3D&amp;reserved=0\">www.caregiver.va.gov</a>.</p>"

          "processed": "<p>After serving four years from 1994 to 1998 as a motor transport truck driver in Okinawa, Japan, and Camp Pendleton, California, Mechenbier returned home to Pittsburgh. He began receiving care at VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System shortly thereafter.</p>\n\n<p>In 2015, he was in a motorcycle accident and broke his left leg in nine places. He lost all the cartilage in his knee and underwent a three-inch bone graft.</p>\n\n<p>“The pain started getting so bad I couldn’t take it,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>A VA Pittsburgh surgeon gave Mechenbier three options: do nothing and continue to live with pain; allow the surgeon to remove everything from Mechenbier’s knee and fuse his upper and lower legs which would leave his leg immobile; or amputate.</p>\n\n<p>“I told my dad about fusing my leg, and he said that’s no good, then you can’t ride your motorcycle,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>Mechenbier chose amputation because he thought it was his best option. VA Pittsburgh surgeons performed the above-the-knee amputation in January 2021.</p>\n\n<p>It typically takes six to eight weeks to create a prosthesis for an amputee, but Mechenbier received his in just three thanks to the work of VAPHS supervisory orthotist/prosthetist Andrew Chambers and his team.</p>\n\n<p>Chambers, himself an Air Force Veteran, introduced an <a href=\"https://www.va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care/stories/you-made-my-year-new-process-improves-prosthetics-rehab-wait-time/\">innovative prosthetic product at the start of the coronavirus pandemic</a> that drastically reduces the timeline for providing Veterans with new limbs following below-the-knee amputations. Chambers then set a goal to expand the technology to serve Veterans with above-the-knee amputations.</p>\n\n<p>Working with Chambers and his team following the amputation, Mechenbier was able to stand in just two weeks and walk in three. He was thrilled to receive his new prosthetic leg at the end of March and requested a video of himself using it to show his parents and wife. He even asked about when he could ride his motorcycle.</p>\n\n<p>“Working with the team, they’ve been incredible,” said Mechenbier. “I can’t even put into words how great they are. Not just Andrew, but also all the nurses and physical therapy staff when I was staying at rehab for a week. Everything was just incredible, you felt like you were at home.”</p>\n\n<p>Mechenbier’s leg prosthesis required initial adjustment, but he soon adapted well, walking around by himself without assistance and successfully managing daily activities.</p>\n\n<p>“It’s like being two years old trying to learn to walk all over again,” said Mechenbier. “So far I’ve been able to do everything I used to do before. I just have to learn to slow down a little bit. I try to go the same speed now.”</p>\n\n<p>In addition to riding his beloved motorcycle, Mechenbier looks forward to participating in bass fishing tournaments and simply enjoying relaxing on Pennsylvania’s many bodies of water.</p>\n\n<p>“I’ve been riding motorcycles since I was five years old, it’s part of me,” said Mechenbier. “It’s great to feel the wind in your face. It’s the closest thing you can get to flying.”</p>\n\n<p>Chambers is grateful for his team’s hard work and effort that led to Mechenbier walking with his new prosthetic.</p>\n\n<p>“This doesn’t happen without them and their expediency to get these types of outcomes,” he said. “I wish more staff could have been in clinic to share in this moment. They’re changing lives for the better.”</p>"

          "processed": "<p>More than a year into his recovery, Yablonski says he can now “do things I haven’t done in years.” He has gained weight and the strength to take up activities such as putting up Christmas decorations, enclosing a front porch to keep mosquitos at bay, exercising daily, and even clearing snow.</p>\n\n<p>“I mean, not that I enjoy it, but I can do it,” said Yablonski, 55, who relied on a neighbor to run the snow blower before he received his new liver. “I’m alive and I praise God because I’m able to.”</p>\n\n<p>Liver transplants can have excellent outcomes and recipients have been known to live normal lives for over 30 years after an operation. During the first year after a liver transplant, patients are constantly monitored and must follow a specific care plan for their recovery, including nutrition and individualized medications.</p>\n\n<p>Patients must take many medications after a liver transplant, some to prevent rejection of the new organ, some to fight infection, and others to treat side effects of the anti-rejection medicine. As patients heal, their medications often decrease, although nearly all patients take anti-rejection medicine for the rest of their lives.</p>\n\n<p>Most patients remain in the hospital for a couple weeks after their transplant, then continue recovery at home. Some patients can return to their jobs and certain activities after about three months.</p>\n\n<p>Yablonski walks on a treadmill every morning and accompanies his wife, Pam, and their dogs to a nearby park. Pam Yablonski said until the transplant, she’d never seen her husband make a point to exercise.</p>\n\n<p>“Now he’s running circles around me,” Pam Yablonski said.</p>\n\n<p>The New York couple even hosted Last for a visit in September, right around the same time as Timothy Yablonski’s birthday and their six-month checkup. Last, of Florida, secretly arranged the visit with Pam Yablonski and an aunt. The aunt met Last at the airport and had her hide in the back of a van. When the van pulled up, the aunt asked Tim Yablonski to unload it.</p>\n\n<p>“He’s talking and talking and opens the van and finally turns and says, are you kidding me?” said Pam Yablonski. “He was so surprised; you should have seen his face. It was awesome!”</p>\n\n<p>Yablonski’s living-donor liver transplant (LDLT) in March 2020 <a href=\"https://www.va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care/stories/a-living-bond-transplant-between-army-veteran-and-daughter-is-vas/\">was the first of its kind for VA</a>, made possible through a collaboration between VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System and UPMC. Since then, VA Pittsburgh has performed one other LDLT, according to Lindsey Herlinger, transplant administrator. She anticipates even more in the future.</p>\n\n<p>VA Pittsburgh is one of 15 total VA transplant centers and is currently the only one offering LDLT services. Any Veteran eligible for VA care in the country who needs a liver transplant has the option of a living donor.</p>\n\n<p>“Our hope is to ensure all Veterans in need of a liver transplant are aware of the LDLT option through our program,” said Herlinger.</p>\n\n<p>The Yablonskis are grateful VA – and their faith – came through for them.</p>\n\n<p> “He’s alive and we’re so thankful for that,” said Pam Yablonski. “God kept him alive so long the way he was. There’s no answer they can give, other than this being a miracle.”</p>\n\n<p><em>Writer’s note: All Veterans enrolled for VA health care are eligible for consideration for transplant services. If you are interested in these services, talk with your primary care provider about a referral.</em></p>"

          "processed": "<p>The two were selected from a field of 12 VA Pittsburgh physicians who received a monthly Chief of Staff Clinical Excellence Award during fiscal year 2020. Voting was open to all VA Pittsburgh staff physicians. The winners received plaques prior to the April medical staff quarterly meeting. </p>\n\n<p>Sgro nominated Hakas for the Chief of Staff award in February. Hakas is an internist, dealing with prevention, diagnoses, and treatment of internal diseases. She works mainly in addiction medicine in the Center for Treatment of Addictive Disorders. She also enjoys working in the emergency department, the hospitalist service, and as a member of the medical ethics team. </p>\n\n<p>“The patients Dr. Hakas cares for are some of the most vulnerable and stigmatized patients who walk through the doors at VA Pittsburgh,” said Sgro. “Elizabeth sets the standard for how to approach every patient with the utmost respect and empathy. Whenever I’m struggling to help a patient with a substance use disorder, I text Elizabeth and she takes time out of her busy schedule to meet them wherever they are.”  </p>\n\n<p>He also noted her support of fellow staff.  </p>\n\n<p>“She’s the person who always remembers your birthday and forces you to take time for yourself when you’re struggling,” he said. “It’s no exaggeration to say that Dr. Hakas has made the whole VA Pittsburgh community a more caring, fun and healthier place.” </p>\n\n<p>Dr. Heather McQuillan nominated Sgro for the Chief of Staff award in January. Sgro, an academic hospitalist, helps train residents and medical students in his position as director of Inpatient Medicine Education. </p>\n\n<p>“In my personal experience working with Gaetan, he has helped me better serve my Veteran population during their transition of care between hospital and home,” said McQuillan. “He has often provided assistance even when he was not the provider caring for the Veteran on the inpatient side. He has been a wonderful colleague and asset to VA Pittsburgh.” </p>\n\n<p>Sgro pioneered VA’s My Life, My Story program at VA Pittsburgh. The program empowered clinical volunteers to record the personal life stories of almost 100 Veteran patients and counting in the medical record. </p>\n\n<p>“Staff not only feel more confident in caring for Veterans after reading these stories, but they also feel more connected to and fulfilled by the work of service,” Sgro said. </p>\n\n<p>For Hakas, the Outstanding Physician award has special meaning after what she described as a difficult year with the pandemic and social and political unrest. Hakas said she draws strength from the words of hospice physician and author BJ Miller, who writes “the most potent form of medicine is to come from a place of love and kindness.” </p>\n\n<p>Her goal now, she said, is “to discover how to be kind and how to walk gently and thoughtfully through life. I tell myself I must stay open-minded, and open-hearted, and keep learning until the day I die. I greatly appreciate the VA as a place where I can feel comfortable being myself and where all Veterans, from every walk of life, can get the care they deserve.” </p>\n\n<p>Both doctors expressed deep appreciation for being selected alongside one another. </p>\n\n<p>“It was a great pleasure to be selected for this honor with Dr. Sgro,” said Hakas, “I know he meets the highest standards in patient care, teaching and overall amazingness.” </p>\n\n<p>Sgro said he is humbled to have been selected by his peers for the award, especially considering the many other VA health care professionals who risk their lives daily during the pandemic to care for Veterans.  </p>\n\n<p>“I don’t think it’s a coincidence that Elizabeth and I are sharing this award,” said Sgro. “We’re both here for the people and their stories, in all their diverse, eccentric, and lovely forms.”</p>"

          "processed": "<p>VA’s National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) received funding to roll out a project seeking to increase Veterans’ access to mobile apps to improve mental health coping and reduce suicide risk.</p>\n\n<p>One medical center in every VISN (Veterans Integrated Service Network) was selected to implement the project locally. When VA Pittsburgh Chief of Chaplain Service Paul Dordal learned about the project, he was immediately interested.</p>\n\n<p>“They had never had a chaplain volunteer, but I saw it as an opportunity,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>Dordal and VAPHS psychologist Dr. Michael Rosen received specific train-the-trainer instruction to become “mHealth specialists.” In this role, they work to empower and assist others, called mHealth ambassadors, to incorporate the mobile mental health apps into care. Anyone with connection to patients can become an ambassador, from psychologists and nurses to peer specialists and MyHealtheVet coordinators.</p>\n\n<p>“We’ve learned those who use mobile mental health apps really like them,” said Dordal. “They appreciate what the apps can do, yet very few Veterans were using them.”</p>\n\n<p>The project’s earliest stages began at the end of 2019, prior to the pandemic. After VAPHS became a participating site, the national center hosted a virtual site visit last October with a project goal of training at least 20 VA staff members per site. VAPHS alone trained 58 new mHealth ambassadors.</p>\n\n<p>The staff members participated in training focused on integrating mobile mental health apps into health care. These mHealth ambassadors also learned how to use the new digital Safety Plan app module, which helps expand the reach of effective suicide prevention tools and resources.</p>\n\n<p>The project challenged ambassadors to introduce and use mobile mental health apps with 25 Veterans or family members per year, with an initial three-month target of about six Veterans per ambassador.</p>\n\n<p>VAPHS far exceeded that goal. During the three-month track period, 35 of the 58 mHealth ambassadors reached about 16 Veterans and in total, VAPHS’s ambassadors introduced apps to 928 Veterans.</p>\n\n<p>The staff share a fun competition of who can introduce the most patients to the apps. One MyHealtheVet coordinator loves presenting to Veterans, including local organizations like the Marine Corps League, and rapidly amassed well more than the encouraged 25.</p>\n\n<p>Dordal himself had an appointment with a Veteran in California who was overwhelmed and having a tough time, sleeping poorly and constantly thinking about his temporary job. Dordal spoke with him about mindfulness and sent him a link to an app from the PTSD center.</p>\n\n<p>“He’s 40 or younger, well versed in mobile phones, so his homework was to download the app and use it five to 10 minutes a day for a week,” said Dordal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Supplement to Care</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some apps can only be used by licensed clinicians, but there are a range of others such as self-care apps, including mindfulness and PTSD apps. One recently developed is the COVID Coach App, designed specifically for people stressing about the pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>“COVID enhanced this project,” said Dordal, “Now because of the lack of face to face, some people aren’t seeing their doctors as much. If COVID weren’t here, the imperative, the motivation to use it would not be as big. When COVID hit, these tools became that much more important. It would have been successful because it’s a good product, but COVID helped it because we needed it more.”</p>\n\n<p>Dordal was clear the apps are a supplement to and not a replacement for professional care. Some apps serve as companions to therapy. A Veteran might see a cognitive behavioral therapist, for example, and use an app daily to help work on developing better sleep habits.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional benefits</strong></p>\n\n<p>Another benefit of the universally available apps is the capacity for caregivers and families to be in care with their Veteran. One mHealth ambassador, a medical doctor, met with a patient and family, showing them how to download and use a mindfulness app.</p>\n\n<p>“The family was really impressed,” said Dordal. “This project is a creative way to help Veterans outside of the traditional care process. It’s not a fad, it’s going to become part of our total health care program.”</p>\n\n<p>Web-based services are also available for any Veterans who don’t consider themselves smart-device savvy. Each app also has a crisis hotline immediately available so users can quickly connect to a live person for help.</p>\n\n<p>“The other big thing is the PTSD Coach app has an electronic suicide safety form,” said Dordal. “If any Veteran has suicidality, they can create a safety plan with their provider and have that right on their phone, instead of written out on a piece of paper.”</p>\n\n<p>Dordal thinks the ambassadors will sustain and increase the amount of people who have access to and use mobile mental health apps.</p>\n\n<p>“This will catch on and become part of the norm,” he said, “Like, ‘take two apps and call me in the morning.’”</p>\n\n<p>The apps empower Veterans to take charge of their health so they don’t become dependent on a professional for something they can do on their own.</p>\n\n<p>“It’s not asking what’s the matter with you, but what matters to you,” said Dordal. “What matters to them is to take control of their own life and health care.”</p>\n\n<p>To learn more about mobile VA health care apps, talk to your care team or visit the <a href=\"https://mobile.va.gov/appstore/\">VA App Store</a>.</p>"

          "processed": "<p>Air Force Veteran Bill Schenker received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Jan. 26 in his home. His wife and caregiver, Lois, also received her first dose of the vaccine. She was eligible as a caregiver in VA’s  <a href=\"https://www.caregiver.va.gov/support/support_benefits.asp\">Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC)</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Bill Schenker served in the Air Force from 1969 to 1972 as a C-130 aircraft mechanic. He was stationed all over the world, including Langley Air Force Base in the U.S. and overseas in Thailand, Vietnam, Germany and England.</p>\n\n<p>After he was discharged from the military, he attended Duquesne University in Pittsburgh and became a full-time certified public accountant upon graduating.</p>\n\n<p>Bill Schenker and his wife have lived in Pittsburgh their entire lives. Wheelchair bound, he has been receiving care at VA for almost 50 years and is a former president of the Paralyzed Veterans of America Keystone Chapter.</p>\n\n<p>“VA has been exceptional,” said Lois Schenker. “We have no complaints about anybody who’s ever been assigned to us.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Safety and in-home COVID-19 Vaccines</strong></p>\n\n<p>HBPC administers the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. It must be kept in ultra-cold storage until it is prepped for use. Once prepped, it can be stored at room temperature for six hours before it must be discarded. Pharmacy staff prep the required number of doses each day for HBPC’s nurses. The nurses travel to eligible Veterans’ homes to administer the vaccine over a four-hour period. Any leftover doses are returned to VA Pittsburgh’s H. John Heinz III campus to be administered to Veterans who have appointments to receive the vaccine.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Heather McQuillan, VA Pittsburgh’s HBPC program medical director, oversees the entire process, to include staying in contact with the nurses as they visit each Veteran.</p>\n\n<p>“Mr. Schenker has been my patient since 2011 and over the years, I have been in awe of his positive outlook despite his medical issues and his wife’s dedication to his care,” said McQuillan.  “When I learned that VAPHS was getting the Pfizer vaccine, my immediate thought was to find a way to bring it to both of them in the home.”</p>\n\n<p>Getting the vaccine to frail, homebound Veterans as quickly as possible is the focus of VA Pittsburgh’s HBPC team, according to Nurse Manager Kari Zana and Associate Chief of Staff for Geriatrics Dr. Steven Handler. </p>\n\n<p>“We believe this approach is innovative and an important service for Veterans,” said Handler.</p>\n\n<p>HBPC nurses follow COVID-19 safety protocols similar to those observed on VA Pittsburgh’s medical campuses. They call ahead of time to screen household members for COVID-19 symptoms, wear face coverings, wash their hands frequently and don gloves during visits.</p>\n\n<p>HBPC visited homes to administer the first 12 doses of COVID-19 vaccines on Jan. 19. By the end of January, over 100 Veterans and at least six eligible caregivers in the PCAFC program had received their first dose of the two-dose vaccine in their homes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>“I cried when I heard I was going to get the vaccine.”</strong></p>\n\n<p>Lois Schenker applied last October for VA’s PCAFC caregiver program and was approved shortly thereafter. Around mid-January she found out she, too, was eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine.</p>\n\n<p>“I cried when I heard I was going to get the vaccine,” said Lois Schenker. “I was so excited. I just can’t go far away from him and stand in a line somewhere. I don’t drive in snow, or in dark. He’s totally 100% dependent on me for everything, so HBPC is a godsend.”</p>\n\n<p>One of the couple’s three children lives about a mile away and helps with grocery shopping, using curbside pickup and minimizing any contact with other people.</p>\n\n<p>“Our son here has our only grandchildren. They’re very, very careful,” said Lois Schenker. “We would like to see our other two kids who live in Florida and Georgia. We haven’t seen them in a year now, only on Facetime.”</p>\n\n<p>The family is very close, normally visiting each other multiple times a year.</p>\n\n<p>“Our lives have really changed because of COVID-19,” said Lois Schenker.</p>\n\n<p>Even though the couple’s other two children had COVID-19, their only daughter, a trauma surgeon in Georgia, received the vaccine.</p>\n\n<p>“She’s planning to come home after our second shot,” said Lois Schenker. “It’s wonderful. It hasn’t been a hassle being here at home, I’m kept busy, but I do miss them a lot.”</p>\n\n<p>The Schenkers said they did not experience serious adverse reactions to the vaccine.</p>\n\n<p>“I would encourage people to get the vaccine,” said Lois Schenker. “There’s less chance of getting COVID if everybody gets the vaccine.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>HBPC at VA Pittsburgh</strong></p>\n\n<p>Bill Schenker uses a VA-provided iPad to receive most of his health care virtually during the pandemic. HBPC nurses have visited his home only a few times, including to administer vaccines such as the one for COVID-19.</p>\n\n<p>Zana said the goal is to provide most Veterans their health care via VA Video Connect and other forms of telemedicine so they don’t have to leave their homes, or invite people into their homes.</p>\n\n<p>“With COVID, we decreased the number of in-person visits because then we can potentially be a vector,” said Zana.</p>\n\n<p>HBPC serves Veterans who need in-home team support for diseases and illnesses that affect their health and daily activities. At VA Pittsburgh, HBPC’s interdisciplinary team includes nurses, a social worker, a pharmacist, physical and occupational rehabilitation therapists, a psychologist, a dietitian, a certified registered nurse practitioner and geriatricians. To participate, Veterans must live in a home appropriate for care that is located within 25 miles of the University Drive campus and be willing to give up their outside primary care provider.</p>\n\n<p>For more information on VA’s HBPC program, visit <a href=\"https://www.va.gov/GERIATRICS/pages/Home_Based_Primary_Care.asp\">Home Based Primary Care</a>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Editor’s note: The ONLY non-Veterans who are eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine from VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System are primary and secondary family caregivers who are registered in </em><a href=\"https://gcc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.va.gov%2Ffamily-member-benefits%2Fcomprehensive-assistance-for-family-caregivers%2F&amp;data=04%7C01%7C%7C1cdf708c788c4d3689d808d8be45f624%7Ce95f1b23abaf45ee821db7ab251ab3bf%7C0%7C0%7C637468554991039408%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=hiD9x3e9a%2FYMLR6R5fvI%2FDOVPZ8VeX%2BCGo3JXv4DpUE%3D&amp;reserved=0\"><em>VA’s Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers</em></a><em> (PCAFC).</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Currently, VAPHS only has approximately 60 PCAFC caregivers enrolled in the program, and we are contacting them directly.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>You can visit </em><a href=\"https://gcc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.va.gov%2Ffamily-member-benefits%2Fcomprehensive-assistance-for-family-caregivers%2F&amp;data=04%7C01%7C%7C1cdf708c788c4d3689d808d8be45f624%7Ce95f1b23abaf45ee821db7ab251ab3bf%7C0%7C0%7C637468554991039408%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=hiD9x3e9a%2FYMLR6R5fvI%2FDOVPZ8VeX%2BCGo3JXv4DpUE%3D&amp;reserved=0\"><em>this website</em></a><em> to learn about eligibility for this program and how to apply.

The ban was meant to prevent transmission of a deadly brain disease commonly known as “mad cow disease.” The fatal disease is believed to be acquired by consuming contaminated beef. U.S. bases at the time sourced potentially tainted beef from the United Kingdom, where the disease was first recognized in 1985.</p>\n\n<p>The FDA made the change after finding there have been no reported cases of the brain disease associated with time spent on U.S. military bases in Europe.</p>\n\n<p>Army Veteran Elizabeth “Liz” Zemba is among thousands of former service members who for decades were told they could not give blood because they were stationed in Germany. Zemba is a technical sergeant in the Pennsylvania Air National Guard, but she previously served as a pharmacy specialist at the former 2nd General Hospital in Landstuhl from 1986 to 1990.</p>\n\n<p>“I was surprised to learn I and other Veterans who had been banned from giving blood are now welcome to once again participate in this potentially lifesaving act,” said Zemba, who until now was last allowed to give blood in the mid-1980s. “I was happy to make my first appointment to donate again.”</p>\n\n<p>Under the new guidelines, persons who had been ineligible because they resided for 6 months or more on U.S. military bases in Germany, the United Kingdom, Belgium and the Netherlands between 1980 and 1990 or on bases in Greece, Turkey, Spain, Portugal and Italy between 1980 and 1996 may now be eligible.</p>\n\n<p>The deferral, however, is still in place for past or recent residency or travel in some European countries. For instance, FDA guidelines do not permit donation by individuals who have spent 3 months or more cumulatively in the United Kingdom from 1980 to 1996.</p>\n\n<p>Two national blood donation centers list eligibility details on their websites: <a href=\"https://www.vitalant.org/Eligibility-(1)/FAQ\">Vitalant</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility\">American Red Cross</a>. Vitalant also welcomes donors to call their medical helpdesk to speak to a registered nurse about eligibility at 412-209-7035. Vitalant anticipates the change will help ease blood shortages due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>“There is an urgent need for blood, platelet and convalescent plasma to provide to area hospitals, so we hope these new FDA guidelines result in previously ineligible individuals coming to donate,” said Kristen Lane of Vitalant. “COVID-19 continues to significantly impact blood drives and has put a strain on the blood supply.”</p>\n\n<p>Lane said all blood types, especially type O, are needed to help ensure patients continue to have the blood they depend on for surgeries and ongoing medical treatment.</p>\n\n<p>Robert Johnson, an Army Veteran now living in Missouri, retired from active duty after serving in multiple locations, including overseas during the late 1990s to early 2000s.</p>\n\n<p>“I always gave blood when I could as a soldier,” said Johnson, who served in Europe from 1995 to 2002 and then was stationed in South Korea before returning stateside.</p>\n\n<p>“So when I was a drill sergeant at Fort Leonard Wood in 2005, I was told that if anyone was stationed in these two places there was a hiatus or wait period on blood donations. I need to start back to doing that again.”</p>\n\n<p>Zemba, who made an appointment to give blood the day after learning she was eligible again, encouraged her fellow Veterans to roll up their sleeves in service to others.</p>\n\n<p>“Giving blood is another chance to serve,” said Zemba. “If you are eligible, consider donating. You could save a life.”</p>\n\n<p>To check your eligibility:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Call the American Red Cross at 866-236-3276.</li>\n\t<li>Call Vitalant at 800-310-9556.</li>\n</ul><p> </p>\n\n<p><em>Writer’s note:</em> You can donate blood during VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System’s virtual blood drive with Vitalant now through Jan. 23, 2021.

          "processed": "<p>Thomas Wojtasiak, a Veteran who resides in the Community Living Center (CLC) on VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System’s H.J. Heinz III campus, looked carefully at the colorful light show displayed on the machine in front of him.</p>\n\n<p>The machine, a Vecta Delight Mobile Sensory Station, appears to be part lava lamp, part laser show and part bubble machine. It can be programmed to emit colorful lights, project calming images onto the ceiling, and play music chosen for the patient’s needs. Therapists use the recently acquired sensory machine as part of the cognitive training they provide to Veterans.</p>\n\n<p>For some Veterans, the machine’s combination of lights, images and music are calming. For others, they are a source of therapeutic stimulation.</p>\n\n<p>For Wojtasiak, it was all about the interaction.</p>\n\n<p>“It really catches your eye,” Wojtasiak said.</p>\n\n<p>Brianna Martin, dance/movement therapist, handed Wojtasiak two items for controlling the machine: a color pad and squeeze ball.</p>\n\n<p>The color pad is a handheld box with six colorful buttons. Veterans push the buttons to change the machine’s brightly lit colors as they wish. They can also tap buttons at their therapist’s direction to match colors as they are displayed by the machine. The squeeze ball allows Veterans to control the speed of bubbles that float upward inside the machine’s narrow plastic tubes.</p>\n\n<p>“It looks like Christmas over there,” Martin said as she moderated Wojtasiak’s therapy session.</p>\n\n<p>Wojtasiak worked with the multimedia wonder machine for about 10 minutes. He so enjoyed the machine’s calming influence he asked if it could be placed in his room to help him fall asleep at night.</p>\n\n<p>When Wojtasiak finished his therapy, Martin’s assistant, intern Helena Barker from Antioch University in New Hampshire, carefully wiped down the machine, color pad and squeeze ball for the next patient to use.</p>\n\n<p>The Vecta, also known as a sensory cart, has quickly become the most popular and requested therapy at Heinz since its acquisition in September. It has different mood effects on different people. Martin said its sound and vision show can be tailored for each Veteran’s condition.</p>\n\n<p>“The biggest advantage I see is that it helps Veterans to be more connected to their immediate experience or be more present in the moment with either myself or Helena,” said Martin. “We can help them calm down or wake them up to their surroundings more.”</p>\n\n<p>On the wards, nurses have also noticed a difference in their patients.</p>\n\n<p>“With our dementia population, we see episodes of confusion and frustration and the sensory cart helps them keep calm and able to concentrate and focus,” said Michelle Clayton, assistant nurse manager.</p>\n\n<p>The Vecta is easy to maintain because its bubble tubes and most everything else on it are made from high-impact plastic. The tubes are even waterless: A fan in the bottom of each gently circulates Styrofoam balls upward to mimic bubbles.</p>\n\n<p>Martin said the machine has already positively impacted Veterans, including one who can agitate easily and has difficulty falling asleep. Just 20 minutes with the machine calms the Veteran to where he now gently falls asleep.</p>\n\n<p>According to Jamie Sloan, recreation and creative arts supervisor, VA Pittsburgh acquired the sensory machine through a grant from the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agency Appropriations Act of 2020.</p>\n\n<p> “We purchased it from a local vendor in neighboring Gibsonia and discussed our needs regarding safety, infection control, ease of use, and dignity related to adult versus child components,” said Sloan, explaining the vendor specializes in children’s sensory toys.</p>\n\n<p>“They built a custom machine for us, modifying the equipment for our mature population, easy maintenance, and infection prevention.”</p>\n\n<p>Sloan said the machine will soon be made available for therapy sessions for all residents in the CLC, once standard operating procedures are finalized.</p>\n\n<p>For now, Veterans on the memory care floor can’t get enough of it.</p>\n\n<p>“It’s an awesome tool to use for dementia,” said nursing assistant Michelle McFadden. “They do so well with it; a lot of our patients are very anxious, and it really relaxes them into a whole different zone.”</p>"

          "processed": "<p>In September, VA Pittsburgh Director Donald Koenig honored Perenovich – now an education specialist – with a 35-year federal service certificate and lapel pin at the Oakland campus. Her family and co-workers couldn’t attend in person, but thanks to state-of-the-art video streaming technology, they shared the moment.</p>\n\n<p>During the virtual ceremony, department leaders highlighted Perenovich’s work ethic and accomplishments as an education specialist, information technology specialist and secretary at VA Pittsburgh and as a VISN 4 Leadership Development Institute coordinator.<br /><br />\n“If (only) I had a dime for every time I had to read a STAR award* for her during a meeting,” said learning resource officer David Julian, emphasizing that she is always “helping people that can’t be helped.”</p>\n\n<p>Her longevity may be attributed to her pride in working for VA.</p>\n\n<p>“I remember my meeting with Tauna like it was yesterday…How grateful she was for all the opportunities the VA has given her. And she took those opportunities,” Education Chief Dr. Thomas Grau said of their first face-to-face meeting.</p>\n\n<p>Grau likened Perenovich’s impact on VA health care to a quote attributed to American educator and presidential advisor Booker T. Washington<em>: </em>“There are two ways of exerting one's strength: one is pushing down, the other is pulling up.”</p>\n\n<p>“Tauna embodies the second part of that,” Grau said.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pulling People Up</strong></p>\n\n<p>The use of technology to celebrate Perenovich’s 35 years of service is not surprising. She rolled into her VA career as the computing industry was rolling out more and more computers, printers and medical devices. But it was through learning specialized skills at the now-closed Bradford Business School in Pittsburgh that she gained an edge over other applicants.<br /><br />\n“I was hired because I was knowledgeable in using the <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/pc/pc_8.html\">IBM Displaywriter</a> word processor – with the big 8-inch disks – one to run it and one to save files on. The food service chief wanted to convert all the job descriptions and patient menus,” Perenovich said.</p>\n\n<p>VA had three of the systems in 1985 at the now decommissioned Highland Drive campus when she started. Now operating with much more responsibility (and pay), she credits her success not only to knowing how to use the Displaywriter, but also to <a href=\"https://www.va.gov/jobs/\">VA employment</a> perks.</p>\n\n<p>“We had the TAP (tuition assistance program). It was a pot of money that they would distribute depending on the number of people that applied. Sometimes we were lucky to get a hundred dollars,” Perenovich said.<br /><br />\nNevertheless, the funds helped her earn an associate’s degree in business management from the <a href=\"https://ccac.edu/\">Community College of Allegheny County</a>. She later earned her bachelor’s degree in health services management from <a href=\"https://www.rmu.edu/\">Robert Morris University</a> and a master’s in professional leadership from <a href=\"https://www.carlow.edu/\">Carlow University</a> with a little VA help, but understanding VA resources remains her strong suit.</p>\n\n<p>“Reading. Knowing. Inquiring. The challenge is knowing who to ask,” Perenovich said, noting human resources and education staff are good sources of knowledge for VA staff.  </p>\n\n<p>“Encouraging entry-level staff that they can do what I did if they take advantage of all that is given them – that is so me,” Perenovich said. “Making sure you’re aware of things. I was never really shy about asking about things.”<br /><br />\nHer sound career advice reflects Perenovich’s willingness to take advice from one of her mother’s friends while she was still at Bradford.<br /><br />\n“Her friend started at entry level and became the supervisor of the Social Security office in Pittsburgh. She retired at 55 with a buyout. She told me that I could make a great federal career. I just needed to get my foot in the door,” Perenovich said. “She was absolutely right!”</p>\n\n<p>Perenovich has taught hundreds of co-workers in the technology, leadership and public speaking skills needed to do their jobs. She has also filled her resume with extracurricular activities over the past 20 years, including volunteering with the <a href=\"https://www.vapghefcu.org/\">VA Pittsburgh Federal Employees Credit Union</a>, serving in leadership positions.</p>\n\n<p>Though she most often educates VA staff, she is proud of her entry-level computer classes for Veterans in VA Pittsburgh’s <a href=\"https://www.va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care/homeless-veteran-care/\">domiciliary</a>.</p>\n\n<p>“More than 300 Veterans have participated. It’s usually the older Veterans – 45 and up – that need assistance. It’s really important, especially in finding a job, because everything is done on computers now,” Perenovich said. “At some point you’re going to have to sit down at a keyboard.”</p>\n\n<p>Reflecting on 35 years of helping Veterans and co-workers and the celebration in September, she realized something.</p>\n\n<p>“I like Dr. Grau’s reference of ‘pulling people up’ and his quote,” Perenovich said. “I get great satisfaction from giving back to people, nurturing and encouraging.”</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p><em>*Special Thanks and Recognition (STAR) Award recipients are nominated by anyone who witnesses a staff member going above and beyond their normal duties.  </em><br /><br />\nVisit our <a href=\"https://www.va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care/work-with-us/\">Work With Us</a> page if you’re interested in employment, volunteer and health care training opportunities at VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System.</p>"

Heinz III campus, arranged for physically distanced learning, and set about teaching Veterans how to sew masks for family and friends. She used patterns to show Veterans how to create masks step by step, from piecing fabric sections together to adding ear straps and finishing touches.</p>\n\n<p>The group of Veterans has been sewing masks a few times a week ever since, making face coverings for their parents, siblings, neighbors, spouses and children. Some Veterans graduated to using their new skill to tailor, stitch and patch personal and work clothing. A few even created footbags, or small bean bags best known by the brand-name Hacky Sack.</p>\n\n<p>Sewing masks doubles as therapy: It promotes a sense of accomplishment and self-care while at the same time giving Veterans a way to care for others while social distancing.</p>\n\n<p>“It also creates positive comradery among Vets and staff,” said Sherer, who gives Veterans all the credit for the project.</p>\n\n<p>Jamie Sloan, recreation and creative arts therapy supervisor, said Sherer’s mask-making program is an ideal example of Veteran-centered care, or involving Veterans in their own care and treatment. Veterans learn a valuable skill in sewing, and the project empowers them to care for others by making masks that limit the spread of the coronavirus. Empowerment, said Sloan, is a critical element of therapy.</p>\n\n<p>One Veteran has made more than 30 masks for his family and fellow Veterans. Another Veteran made a mask for his young daughter and a miniature mask for the girl’s baby doll.</p>\n\n<p>Sloan said the therapeutic rehabilitation program lets Veterans know they are capable, and that someone cares about them enough to invest time in teaching them a new skill.</p>\n\n<p>“Veterans got that message lima Charlie, which is military lingo for loud and clear,” Sloan said. “They internalized the message and now make masks to protect their families and fellow Veterans.”</p>\n\n<p>Veterans and VAPHS staff are welcome to sew masks at the weekly sessions. Voluntary Service provides the materials and participants can work on either of two sewing machines – one of which is Sherer’s personal machine.</p>\n\n<p>To learn how you can get involved, call 412-822-1401.</p>"

          "processed": "<p>Sometimes, even when every preventive effort is made, a suicide cannot be prevented. When a Veteran does die by suicide, a special team of social workers and chaplains come together to provide postvention. Suicide postvention is immediate and ongoing support to those impacted by a suicide loss. It is critical for healing.</p>\n\n<p>VA Pittsburgh’s suicide postvention team consists of social workers Sarah Woodring and Vanessa Beck and chaplains Gretchen Hulse and Katie Maul. Together, they help grieving families during what for many is  the worst ordeal of their lives. Team members provide a safe space, a listening ear, and any available resources that may be needed.</p>\n\n<p>“There’s a lot of sorrow, sadness and anger, and we reach out to family and providers in the midst of that,” said Maul.</p>\n\n<p>For every life lost to suicide, 135 people are exposed, said Woodring. Postvention is crucial because knowing someone who died by suicide increases one’s own risk for suicide. Follow-up is just as important, she said, because everyone grieves at their own pace.</p>\n\n<p>The postvention team works with Veterans’ families and VAPHS staff who treated the Veteran – all are affected by the death. The team also hosts an Annual Day of Remembrance, now in its third year, to bring family and staff together to remember the deceased.</p>\n\n<p>Beck said the Day of Remembrance is a way to honor Veterans, as well as to provide postvention to staff. It is often the only opportunity for Veterans’ providers to come together to grieve and remember.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to providing spiritual and moral support for survivors, the postvention team also can assist families with funeral arrangements, life insurance and 401(k) benefits.</p>\n\n<p>“We make sure nothing is lost in the system for a family member,” said Woodring. “It’s hard enough to grieve without worrying about that stuff.”</p>\n\n<p>Follow-up includes regular mailings to family and staff to remind them the team is there, if they need them.</p>\n\n<p>The postvention team’s mission has been made even harder by the coronavirus pandemic. Beck said the traditional rituals of funerals and burials have been disrupted by social distancing, so team members use virtual tools such as Zoom meetings to reach survivors. Any connection to help survivors grieve, she said, is important.</p>\n\n<p>“Death really needs to be marked when it happens,” Beck said. “If not, it complicates grief.”</p>\n\n<p>Each member of the team takes their special responsibility to heart. Beck said she values her postvention work and compares the team to a lotus flower, which blooms from the mud – that out of tragedy, something can grow.</p>\n\n<p>“We try to bring something beautiful and meaningful out of grief,” said Beck. “It’s a true privilege to be let into people’s lives over something so intimate and personal and provide meaningful support.”</p>\n\n<p>Editor’s note: To get in touch with a member of the team, call the Suicide Prevention Office at (412) 360-3412.</p>\n\n<p>We encourage Veterans to engage in VA care well before they are in crisis: Of the 16.8 Veterans who died by suicide each day in 2019 (most recent data available), 11 were <strong>not </strong>enrolled in VA health care.

Care begins with a holistic approach to maximize remaining vision so Veterans can achieve goals such as seeing food on a plate, signing a check, watching television or reading.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In-Home Care with Telehealth</strong></p>\n\n<p>Veterans William Bowling and Dennis Serrano both receive in-home, low-vision care through telehealth.</p>\n\n<p>Bowling, 94, enlisted in the Navy in November 1944 before graduating high school. He trained in Amarillo, Texas, as a mechanic for B-17 and B-29 bombers as World War II was winding down in Europe.</p>\n\n<p>A Washington, Pennsylvania, resident, Bowling has received low-vision care at VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System (VAPHS) since 2018. VAPHS recently provided him with equipment for the telehealth visits and had a blind rehabilitation specialist visit his home to ensure he understands how to use it.</p>\n\n<p>“I just can’t say enough about the service,” said Bowling. “It’s just been great. They gave me all kinds of equipment. I couldn’t read anything, and now I can.”</p>\n\n<p>Serrano, 91, served with the Army during the Korean War as a radar technician. After transitioning out, he worked as an Air Force contract engineer on simulation devices for over 20 years.</p>\n\n<p>Born and raised in Pittsburgh, Serrano relies on public transportation to VAPHS for appointments, including low-vision care. Since COVID-19 restrictions, he’s begun using telehealth from his home.</p>\n\n<p>“I personally think this system is excellent,” said Serrano. “I don’t have to worry about the bus schedule, and I get to talk face to face with my doctors and everyone. I enjoy it.”</p>\n\n<p>He said the in-home therapy allows him to maintain his independence.</p>\n\n<p>“I do everything on the computer, my banking, pay my bills, shop for items I might need,” said Serrano. “I try to do as much as I can on my own. This gives me a sense of independence that I can do things for myself.”</p>\n\n<p>The telehealth visits also provide healthy social interactions for Veterans who might feel isolated at home during COVID-19.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Clinical Video Telehealth Helps Erie and Clarksburg Veterans</strong></p>\n\n<p>Using Clinical Video Telehealth (CVT), Veterans in Erie and Clarksburg, West Virginia, can now receive low-vision care without having to travel to VA medical centers in Pittsburgh, Cleveland or Buffalo. CVT uses real-time, secure interactive video conferencing to provide care to Veterans remotely. It typically links a patient at a clinic to a VA provider in another location.</p>\n\n<p>Veterans in Erie and West Virginia connect in real time with a VAPHS low vision occupational therapist to learn visual skills, adaptations and modifications for daily living activities. Patients with macular degeneration learn how to shift their eyes to maximize remaining vision, a skill known as “eccentric viewing.” Veterans also learn how to use optical and electronic magnification devices combined with practical techniques to reach their goals.</p>\n\n<p>“It takes a village to do this,” said Amy Rebovich, a VAPHS low vision occupational therapist who provides the therapy via CVT.  “It’s really exciting that this has been working so smoothly. Veterans love it.”</p>\n\n<p>Rebovich said Clarksburg Veterans who need rehabilitation services are “thrilled at the prospect” of using CVT so they don’t have to travel to Pittsburgh or Washington in Pennsylvania or Martinsburg, West Virginia.</p>\n\n<p>In Erie, VA optometrist Dr. Delia Landy said using CVT to provide low-vision rehabilitation is proving to be beneficial to Veterans.</p>\n\n<p>“It’s wonderful to provide a service to our Veterans where I can begin teaching them a concept during their exam,” said Landy, director of Erie VA’s Optometry Resident and Low Vision programs. “Then Amy can really solidify the information with the Veteran and give them homework to practice using their eyes in unique ways to maximize their remaining vision.”</p>\n\n<p>Landy’s teammate, Laryssa Stolar, visual impairment service team coordinator, was excited to see the progress.</p>\n\n<p>“Erie and Pittsburgh broke down the silos and to become ‘one VA’ and meet the needs of our low vision Veterans,” Stolar said.</p>\n\n<p>The pandemic has brought to light Veterans’ critical need for socialization when pursuing vision goals. Veterans, especially those with vision loss, sometimes feel isolated, which can affect emotional and mental health, and sometimes motivation.</p>\n\n<p>Rebovich said despite all the uncertainty during the pandemic, low-vision limitations and other personal challenges, her Veteran patients have been adaptable and motivated to embrace a new care method.</p>\n\n<p>“The most important part is Veterans can stay at home,” said Rebovich. “I’m really proud of our Vets, and many are in their 80s and 90s. They can stay safe, especially during the pandemic, and still get the excellent care they deserve.”</p>\n\n<p>To learn more, talk to your primary care provider or call 412-822-2125.</p>"

          "processed": "<p>Many LGBT Veterans who experienced <a href=\"https://www.va.gov/health-care/health-needs-conditions/military-sexual-trauma/\">military sexual trauma (MST)</a> keep it a secret when they exit the service. They can receive counseling and treatment at VA, but they don’t reach out because they fear VA will judge them the same as their military branches judged them.</p>\n\n<p>VA social worker Abbie Lieberum says that’s not so.</p>\n\n<p>“VA’s policies are separate from the Department of Defense’s policies,” said Lieberum. “We have policies and directives that guide LGBT Veteran care, and we even have LGBT Veteran Care Coordinators to help Veterans navigate and get their care.”</p>\n\n<p>The VA also has strict non-discrimination policies that guide the care LGBT Veterans receive. The VA strives to provide affirming and non-discriminatory care as well as adopting a sensitive, affirming, welcoming, patient-centered approach toward care of those with MST and who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or a related identity.</p>\n\n<p>One Veteran who Lieberum helped to heal is Takia Mitchell, 35, of Pittsburgh.</p>\n\n<p>Mitchell served as an aviation operations specialist in the regular Army from 2004 to 2007. After “don’t ask, don’t tell” was repealed, she joined the Army Reserve for three years as a public affairs specialist.</p>\n\n<p>Mitchell had served in the regular Army without incident as an openly gay service member at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, where she had support from her section sergeant and sergeant major.</p>\n\n<p>But after transferring to Fort Drum, New York, a horrific night in 2007 changed everything. It all started, strangely enough, with a promotion.</p>\n\n<p>“I had an outstanding service record and my section needed a section sergeant,” said Mitchell. “Despite  being at my new unit at Fort Drum for only about a month, my leaders in my unit believed that I would be perfect in this position since I was on track to become a sergeant. At that time, I was only a specialist.”</p>\n\n<p>Mitchell recounted that other soldiers in the section were not thrilled with the news. Mitchell knew one male soldier was probably going to give her a hard time, so she had him accompany her on a routine visit to another facility to talk and, in Mitchell’s words, “let him know I was not a threat.”</p>\n\n<p>It was during that conversation that Mitchell felt comfortable enough to let her guard down and tell the male soldier she is gay. Whether taking that risk led to what happened later, Mitchell may never know for sure. But a secret she had kept on the advice of another Ft. Drum soldier friend of hers was out.</p>\n\n<p>One month later, a male and female soldier stopped by her dorm to chat. The female soldier, known to Mitchell, left, leaving her alone with the male. After about 15 minutes, the male soldier told Mitchell he had heard she was a lesbian. Mitchell denied it, remembering the advice of her female soldier friend.</p>\n\n<p>“At that point, he said he was going to (expletive) the gay out of me,” said Mitchell. “The rest is a blur. I remember fragments of the worst moments of my life. I vaguely remember screaming and my roommate’s boyfriend who was sleeping in the room stopping the situation and asking me what I wanted to do. I don’t remember answering him.”</p>\n\n<p>Mitchell was torn on what to do. She didn’t want her family to know what had happened since they were already embarrassed by her sexual orientation, and she was afraid they wouldn’t support her. In the end, Mitchell chose to stay silent about the attack but knew she needed to get out of the Army.</p>\n\n<p>A friendly chaplain interceded with her commander, who arranged for a discharge under honorable conditions for self-identifying as homosexual.</p>\n\n<p>Mitchell may have left the Army, but the incident did not leave her.</p>\n\n<p>“After getting out of the military, that is when my PTSD symptoms began to show,” said Mitchell. “It was almost as if the life had literally been sucked out of me. I went from a fun, happy, energized person to a shell of a person.”</p>\n\n<p>But Mitchell refused to recognize her own trauma and instead tried to normalize her emotions and regard the incident as just another day in the Army.</p>\n\n<p>“I was walking around in shock,” said Mitchell. “No one even noticed.”</p>\n\n<p>Mitchell still felt as if she hadn’t accomplished what she set out to do in the Army, and she was mindful of her parent’s disappointment that she had left the service. So when “don’t ask, don’t tell” was repealed in 2011, she reenlisted.</p>\n\n<p>But Mitchell was now sensitized to her surroundings. At her post at Fort Hunter Liggett, California, she was acutely aware the reserves were no haven from sexual harassment.</p>\n\n<p>One evening, Mitchell was out with a group of friends at an off-post club.</p>\n\n<p>“I saw one of my friends get sexually assaulted and almost dragged into a car,” said Mitchell. “When the officer (who assaulted her) was called on his behavior, he threatened to turn in all the women for being at an off-base club when they were not supposed to be.”</p>\n\n<p>Although a senior noncommissioned officer defused the situation, the officer was never punished for his actions.</p>\n\n<p>“We still had to work with him every day,” Mitchell recalled.</p>\n\n<p>After Mitchell left the Army Reserve in 2014, her PTSD symptoms worsened. She began to cut herself and had serious thoughts of suicide.</p>\n\n<p>“I knew I had to do something and now it was a matter of life or death,” said Mitchell. “Either I was going to get help, or I was going to jump off a bridge – literally.”</p>\n\n<p>Since Mitchell had trouble trusting people, it was hard for her to find a civilian therapist. Eventually, she set up a therapy session at a local <a href=\"https://www.vetcenter.va.gov/\">Vet Center</a>. That was the start of her healing.</p>\n\n<p>“Many days, I had to force myself to come to my therapy session, especially in the beginning,” said Mitchell. “But I knew if I didn’t go to therapy, I was killing myself. My dedication to my recovery was literally life or death.”</p>\n\n<p>Mitchell worked with Lieberum on recovering from sexual trauma. But Lieberum and all the people at the <a href=\"https://www.va.gov/directory/guide/facility.asp?ID=589\">White Oak Vet Center</a> mean much more to Mitchell for another reason.</p>\n\n<p>“When I walked into Abbie’s office at the Vet Center, I saw people wearing rainbow-colored lanyards,” said Mitchell. “That told me they are understanding of what I’ve gone through.”</p>\n\n<p>Mitchell said she soon realized what had happened to her was not her fault.</p>\n\n<p>“There came a point in therapy when I realized it wasn’t my fault – that I didn’t do anything wrong and that living detached wasn’t normal,” said Mitchell. “That’s when I chose life. I decided that I wanted to live. It’s been some intense therapy work. I see the light at the end of the tunnel now. I have my own apartment, (which is) something I couldn’t do before because of my PTSD symptoms. I will say this, this fight to get my life back has not been easy, but it is very worth it.”</p>\n\n<p>Mitchell said she hopes her story inspires other Veterans to seek VA’s help.</p>\n\n<p>“I would like my story to push Veterans to seek therapy and help with dealing with mental health issues,” she said.</p>\n\n<p>Lieberum said some who experience MST are more affected than others.</p>\n\n<p>“There is a higher incidence of sexual trauma with the LGBTQ population,” said Lieberum. “I encourage anyone who experienced MST in the military to come to a Vet Center or seek help at VA. We are here for you.”</p>\n\n<p>Editor’s note: Visit <a href=\"https://www.va.gov/find-locations/?facilityType=vet_center\">Find VA Locations</a> to find a Vet Center near you.</p>"

Heinz III campus Community Living Center (CLC) rather than in a formal chapel setting.</p>\n\n<p>“As I do ministry on the CLC units, I find it’s becoming more intimate and personal because of the smaller groups,” said Shortt. “The Veterans get to know me, and I get to know them more closely. There is no longer the larger crowd, but people who want to understand their spirituality more deeply.”</p>\n\n<p>During a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/VAPHS/posts/10157235460251820?__xts__%5b0%5d=68.ARAKjPO2FGOKYnk9PApPdVhNwCXKTt5vesjZwtZRvFpFqLFvX0klsw9kMswIzF-MMgDTg_DiEUjmfvA_ehQtdt7QXC9EoiH_IE4nZB7aZStuPZitJHmR670volkZlete8JM_w3eg8pw1f0LRT-C-Zof1FOwFhwITaZhMabrVRMqGibbCec-Yg5GO2nPQmdICWyusomzEFaj5iE5VFmThNmbTsWz364uNXiKLCKFO8DHcVpciThFchlnZe21fWYRe5m-Dmde0l7nXB3_PTk_KL7Se9kkJSoleOd5ld_DvkVZmWKIOnuChu_OJzFAkEcHWGeHMdlEfTsrlvEavlc1uQCcfqHkhMO_ARY43Nf2h9R8RpwuWv7YawyQIslqjA9feP4VQsAgHa82DRcrb4Ph4mkzXeDlFMW0JV3YUIXrg631kbb58LfJ9dBNybxtww0_zDxg3BxsEHAyjiHnI-6pH5mHvtTfsnxVr-nXqtos5fUdCVdMIiDVFyKLA4Js&amp;__tn__=-R\">livestreamed town hall</a> in August, VAPHS Director Donald Koenig acknowledged the chaplains’ work.</p>\n\n<p>“Our chaplains have been phenomenal, sitting with Veterans and an iPad so families can spend some time with their loved ones,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>Chaplain Gretchen Hulse provides tele-ministry for Veterans and families at death, one of the hardest times for all relationships.</p>\n\n<p>“I am honored to help facilitate tele-video encounters between patients on our COVID isolation units and their families,” said Hulse. “One Veteran’s health was rapidly deteriorating. I was able to offer spiritual care and support as the family wrestled with the reality that their loved one was likely not going to survive to the end of the week.”</p>\n\n<p>Hulse brought a smart tablet to the Veteran’s unit and coordinated with the family for a tele-video call where over 20 extended family members saw their loved one and said final goodbyes. </p>\n\n<p>“In this way, the family could let him know they were with him,” said Hulse. “Chaplains are uniquely positioned to providing meaningful, personal connection in a time when so much fear and grief abound.”</p>\n\n<p>Chaplain Sharieda Patterson, the lead chaplain at the H.J. Heinz III campus, provides inpatient and outpatient care to primary and home care Veterans using VA Video Connect.</p>\n\n<p>“We have assisted Veterans who are on home hospice and their families remain connected during this crisis,” said Patterson.</p>\n\n<p>She also helped create the primary care chaplain telephone clinic to meet needs of specific Veterans.</p>\n\n<p>“We created the telephone clinic specifically for those Vets who neither have nor want smartphone technology or feel they are not tech savvy,” said Patterson.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to caring for patients, VAPHS chaplains serve fellow staff and each other, too. Heinz campus chaplains meet weekly to support and pray for each other. One chaplain resident felt anxious when the pandemic began, “but found peace and a new zeal to continue the good work we are so blessed to do,” said Patterson.</p>\n\n<p>“Our charge is not only to care for Veterans, their families and staff, but to each other,” said Patterson. “Ours is a ministry of humility and service and I am so very proud to serve alongside other chaplains who have answered the call to serve.”</p>\n\n<p>Chaplain Katie Maul visits staff regularly to extend care.</p>\n\n<p>“As a part of my work week, I’ve had the honor to participate in team huddles and spend more time with doctors, nurses, EMS (Environmental Management Services) workers and a slew of other VA employees to check in with them and see how they’re doing,” said Maul. “Our staff here at VA Pittsburgh have been great, they continue to show up, putting care for our Veterans first.”</p>\n\n<p>Like other chaplains, Maul feels called to be a “calm amidst the storm” in the face of overwhelming fear and uncertainties.</p>\n\n<p>“Sometimes I encounter staff who seem beside themselves with stress and worry,” she said. “I spoke with a nurse who shared how prayer and meditation were a calming source and seemed to bring strength. So as requested by this staff member, we prayed. I can be a supportive presence, offering spiritual care and reminding Veterans and staff they are cared for and not alone. It’s humbling work we do and it's an honor to be part of this mission.”</p>\n\n<p>Dordal says he is proud to see his team continue serving, walking the floors and visiting intensive care units. Chaplains have helped families say goodbye to loved ones through video conferencing; provided rites and rituals many depend on for solace; ministered to stressed and grieving staff who faithfully serve in their health care roles; and expanded their reach to many outpatients who could not come to the hospital, according to Dordal.</p>\n\n<p>“Throughout our response to the pandemic, I have not heard one chaplain say to me, ‘I can’t do it anymore,’” said Dordal. “Instead, we continue asking, ‘What else can we do to serve our country’s Veterans and their caregivers?’”</p>\n\n<p><a> </a></p>\n\n<p>An Army Veteran, himself, Dordal served as a combat chaplain during the Iraq War.</p>\n\n<p>“Chaplains maintain a calm, non-anxious and nonjudgmental presence throughout the hospital for the benefit of all people, regardless of faith or spiritual beliefs. For those called by their higher power to serve as chaplains, when crises come, we will always be there,” he said. “This health care crisis is similar to combat in the sense that wherever the hurting are, wherever the wounded are, wherever those who die are, there you will find a chaplain.”</p>\n\n<p>If you’d like support from chaplains during this time, call 412-822-1551.</p>"

Raab, who conducts the weekly video sessions.</p>\n\n<p>Mantram repetition differs a bit from standard meditation, Raab said. </p>\n\n<p>“A mantram is a spiritual word or phrase that a person repeats, such as “Jesus, Jesus” or “om mandi padme hum,” said Raab. “The idea behind this practice is that each person has inner resources, like patience, love and compassion, already inside of them, but often can’t access these resources when they want or need to because the mind is all sped up.”</p>\n\n<p>According to Raab, mantram repetition has been practiced in different forms since the early 1990s, when it was developed for work with HIV and AIDS patients.</p>\n\n<p>“It’s been researched in VA for about 20 years now with different groups of Veterans,” Raab said. “A friend in school introduced me to the practice. I was skeptical at first, but 12 years later I’m still practicing, and it’s done a ton for me.”</p>\n\n<p>Veterans use <a href=\"https://mobile.va.gov/app/va-video-connect\">VA Video Connect</a> to participate in the program’s 90-minute group sessions over eight weeks with other Veterans. Raab said the focus is on Veterans supporting one another and practicing the skills to better cope and be happier.  </p>\n\n<p>“Research shows that when people complete the treatment, they’re better able to manage anger, have less problems with sleep, and also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W87-18ZeWw\">less problems related to trauma and mood symptoms</a>,” said Raab. “That’s been my experience, as well, holding the groups with Veterans here in Pittsburgh.” </p>\n\n<p>Raab said mantram repetition is not tailored to any religious faith, and that appeals of the mantram are found in all the world’s major religions.</p>\n\n<p>“If a Veteran has concerns, I do my best to highlight the connections to their faith and help them tailor it, so it fits within their religious practice,” said Raab. “The term mantram, for example, is often most associated with Hinduism or Buddhism, but you can also find it in Christianity under another name, prayer word.  For instance, the phrase, ‘my God and my all’ is associated with St. Francis of Assisi and is one of many choices Veterans can choose from when picking a mantram in the group.”</p>\n\n<p>For more information on mantram repetition at VA Pittsburgh, Veterans can call  412-360-1443.</p>"

          "processed": "<p>After suffering for more than five years with liver cirrhosis, Yablonski received the gift of life – a portion of liver from his stepdaughter, Alyssa Last.</p>\n\n<p>The surgery took place in March when VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System and UPMC partnered to perform VA’s first living-donor liver transplant.</p>\n\n<p>“As soon as we found out he was able to receive a living-donor liver transplant, I wanted to help,” said Last. “I was the first one who applied and was evaluated for it.”</p>\n\n<p>Yablonski said Last’s generosity saved his life.</p>\n\n<p>“It made me feel incredible that my daughter wanted to support me,” said Yablonski. “What my doctor told me after the transplant is my daughter kept me alive.”</p>\n\n<p>The family believes the match and successful surgery were meant to be, taking personal strength from the connection between the date of the surgery and a Bible verse they value.</p>\n\n<p>“The surgery was ‘3-16’ like John 3:16,” said Yablonski. “So, it was like a literal promise.”</p>\n\n<p>The widely quoted Bible verse John 3:16 reads: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</p>\n\n<p>Last herself had been involved in an accident a year before, requiring surgery and hospital care.</p>\n\n<p>“There was no way I should have been able to go through the surgery with the injuries I had,” she said. “I was healthy enough to do so, which was amazing. That and the fact that he’s not my biological dad and I matched him perfectly, it had to be.”</p>\n\n<p>According to VAPHS transplant administrator Lindsey Herlinger, any Veteran eligible for VA care in the country who needs a transplant has the option of a living donor.</p>\n\n<p>“It’s especially beneficial for those who would normally wait a long time for an organ,” said Herlinger. “It can shave years off the wait and free up a liver from the deceased donors list.\"</p>\n\n<p>The family returned to Pittsburgh for follow-up care in late June. They proudly wore matching shirts signed by their care teams and bearing unique phrases. Yablonski’s shirt reads “I now carry a piece of my daughter (A-frame) with me where ever I go. 3:16 2020,” and Last’s shirt reads “My dad has always been one of my heroes, now I am one of his. 3:16 2020.”</p>\n\n<p>Yablonski’s living-donor transplant surgery is the first for VA. VA Pittsburgh is one of 13 VA transplant centers, performing in-house liver, kidney and living-donor kidney transplants. It is the only VA hospital accepting referrals for both living-donor liver transplants and small bowel transplants.</p>\n\n<p>“It’s important to offer this to all Veterans, not just here in Pittsburgh, but to all Veterans across the country,” said Dr. Abhinav Humar, chief of transplantation at UPMC and one of the surgeons who helped with Yablonski’s transplant. “This case was really special because it allowed us to partner with our VA colleagues and offer this life saving procedure to a segment of the population who didn’t previously have this available.”</p>\n\n<p>“It’s incredible being a Veteran and being the first one,” said Yablonski. “It was so good to be supported through the whole process, and God willing, I made it all the way through the end and got a liver from my daughter. And just to go on with life, I’m 54 years old and it’s nice to be able to complete my 20 or 30 years, whatever I have left.”</p>\n\n<p>Yablonski and Last said they’ve always been close, but the surgery bonded them.</p>\n\n<p>“You do what you can for the people you love,” said Last.</p>\n\n<p><em>All Veterans enrolled for VA health care are eligible for consideration for transplant services. If you are interested in these services, talk with your primary care provider about a referral.</em></p>"

The therapy involves treating infected patients with donated blood plasma containing COVID-19 antibodies. Antibodies are immune system proteins that help fight infections. When COVID-19 antibodies are present in donated plasma, the plasma is given to a person with the virus to see if it will help them.</p>\n\n<p>Convalescent therapy has been used successfully to fight other viruses such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), bird flu and even Ebola.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Brooke Decker, VA Pittsburgh director of infection prevention, is one of the investigators in the national study.</p>\n\n<p>“The neatest thing about the plasma treatment is that you have people who have been through a bad disease leaning in to help others who are going through the same thing,” she said. “It’s really nice and human, and we’re really happy to be a part of this at VA Pittsburgh.”</p>\n\n<p>More than 1,000 medical sites nationwide are participating in the study, funded by the National Institutes of Health.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Faraaz Shah, a research fellow at VA Pittsburgh, is the medical center’s principal investigator.</p>\n\n<p>“Coronavirus is the biggest health challenge we’ve had in a very long time,” said Shah. “It’s very early and right now we don’t have a lot of treatments available.

Did you have a strong background in coordinating care for LGBT Veterans?</strong> I joined Dr. (Dawnelle) Paldino as one of the VA Pittsburgh LGBT Veteran care coordinators in 2017. Prior to that, I had been the point of contact for completing the annual Healthcare Equality Index for the Human Rights Campaign at VA Pittsburgh since 2015. This really helped me to learn VA policy and all of the different ways an organization can<strong> </strong>create a welcoming environment for all, which ultimately helped to prime me for the LGBT VCC role.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell me about leadership support? </strong>We have always been fortunate at VA Pittsburgh to have strong leadership support. Previous and current leadership have attended VA Pittsburgh LGBT events and have always expressed their priority to welcome and serve all Veterans at VA Pittsburgh.</p>\n\n<p><strong>During your years as LGBT VCC, what did you learn about LGBT Veterans and what they want/need from VA in terms of care?</strong> I have certainly learned a lot while in this role. However, everything usually comes back to respect. All Veterans deserve our respect. As VA employees, it is our responsibility to educate ourselves so we can create a safe space for all Veterans, particularly those who may be hesitant to access VA health care because they have been stigmatized or mistreated at some point in their lives.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What was good? What was lacking? Were you able to advocate for and/or improve or add services?</strong>  With the support of VA Pittsburgh leadership and employees, we as an organization have really grown and have been recognized within VA and within the community for providing comprehensive and welcoming care to LGBT Veterans. We have also worked hard to educate and provide support to VA Pittsburgh employees and staff and expand our presence and outreach in the community.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you think VA Pittsburgh providers’ knowledge of LGBT care has improved? What about their general attitude of or interest in LGBT care, even if they don’t have LGBT Veterans on their schedule? </strong>Over the last several years, there has certainly been a focused effort at VA to implement policy and provide education and support to employees so that culturally sensitive care is provided to LGBT Veterans.<strong> </strong>This effort has been reflected locally here at VA Pittsburgh, as providers, clinicians, supervisors and individual employees regularly reach out to increase their knowledge and better equip themselves to provide competent care for LGBT Veterans.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What would you tell </strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/va-pittsburgh-healthcare-system/meetthestaffmonday/10157012248896400/?av=374660806819&amp;eav=AfZAKrk6lMCt49vbAGEsYpHG-puoFBHiiGfQEYlCfOam1ybfHpIaQ39HPXTYEmqC4-g\"><strong>Kristen Lyons</strong></a><strong>, who assumed your role in early June, to look out for? What are some good resources for her, Veterans and VA staff?</strong>  Thanks to Dr. Paldino, one of VA Pittsburgh’s greatest resources for staff and Veterans is our Interdisciplinary Transgender Treatment Team. This team consists of over 20 clinicians in various areas and specialties who are true experts in providing LGBT Veteran care within their respective fields. This team is an invaluable resource to VA Pittsburgh staff and is a best practice for providing comprehensive care to Veterans who identify as transgender or a related identity.</p>\n\n<p><em>*Merlina continues to partner with the White Oak Vet Center for an LGBTQ Veteran<strong> </strong>Support Group meeting. The meeting allows Veterans to share thoughts and feelings, explore creative ways to cope with challenges, and learn from one another. The meeting also offers group discussions, education and support on coming out to friends and family, LGBT history, intimate relationships, social support, readjustment issues, mental health issues, sexual orientation and community resources. Veterans interested in joining the group may contact Merlina at 412-216-3711 or Abbie Lieberum (White Oak Vet Center) at 412-678-7704.</em></p>"

Her most recent assignment as a volunteer with VA's Disaster Emergency Medical Personnel System (DEMPS), however, proved challenging.  </p>\n\n<p>Johnson, 62, of Pittsburgh, spent three weeks in May at the New Jersey State Veterans Nursing Home in Paramus.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.va.gov/vhaemergencymanagement/cemp/cemp_demps.asp\">DEMPS</a> is VA's  main deployment program for clinical and non-clinical staff to an emergency or disaster. It is an integral part of VA's fourth mission – to help non-VA medical facilities in need.</p>\n\n<p>Before volunteering for DEMPS, Johnson oversaw the conversion of a vacated wing on VA Pittsburgh's H.J. Heinz III campus into a COVID-19 unit.</p>\n\n<p>When EMS was finished, doctors, nurses, chaplains and other VA Pittsburgh staff who toured the unit \"couldn't believe what we had done – they wished we had taken photos before we started, for before and after photos,\" said Johnson.</p>\n\n<p>With the success of that project in mind, Johnson was ready when the call came for volunteers to help in New Jersey. She  and her team had worked magic at the Heinz facility, but the uncertainty of what she would  face in New Jersey was something altogether more challenging.</p>\n\n<p>\"People were dying there,\" Johnson said. \"Nothing could really prepare you for what you were going to experience. The staff was broken down there. People on the outside were calling them murderers.\"</p>\n\n<p>But with her years of experience managing people, Johnson knew the first thing she had to do was restore pride and purpose to the demoralized staff.</p>\n\n<p>\"I had to tell their housekeeping staff they weren't losers, that they were still in their patients' corner, and that people on the outside really didn't know their situation, or the circumstances.\"</p>\n\n<p>Johnson then turned her attention to educating staff on ways to prevent cross-contamination.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's like mopping one room with the same bucket and a mop and then going to the next room and using the same dirty mop and water,\" Johnson said. \"They had to learn that they needed a clean mop for the next job; clean goes with clean and dirty goes with dirty.\"</p>\n\n<p>The staff had also been spraying bleach on surfaces and immediately wiping them down, but that disinfection method was ineffective. The bleach wasn't left on surfaces long enough to kill viruses, bacteria and fungi. Using spray bottles also spread irritating bleach fumes throughout the facility.</p>\n\n<p>Johnson had the facility replace the bleach solution with a different, more effective disinfectant that kills the virus faster and is safer for staff, patients and the environment.</p>\n\n<p> \"They also had to learn about dwell time – the time it takes for the chemical to kill the virus, and why you have to leave things wet for it to work,\" said Johnson.</p>\n\n<p>But the biggest thing the staff didn't have was a standard operating procedure (SOP) to guide their work. Johnson crafted one for the facility, as well as another to be used by National Guardsmen who  had been called in to assist.</p>\n\n<p>Johnson has since returned to VA Pittsburgh, but she and the nursing home staff stay in touch to talk about the best ways to keep COVID-19 at bay.</p>\n\n<p>Johnson said she would tell anyone volunteering for DEMPS duty to understand that they need to be mentors, not task masters.</p>\n\n<p>\"It was a humbling experience,\" Johnson said. \"In the midst of everything that was happening, the staff was still smiling and willing to learn. The important thing that we all realized is that one day you may be in that bed, and you may have to depend on other people doing the same job you do. In the end, it's not about us – it's about the patient.\"</p>"

The new product dramatically reduces the time between amputation and the start of rehabilitation.</p>\n\n<p>Traditionally, patients are seen in clinic six to eight weeks after surgery to be fitted for a prosthesis, said Andrew Chambers, the VA Pittsburgh orthotist/prosthetist who worked with Slaughter. VA then contracts with a vendor to make the prosthesis. The vendor delivers the prosthesis in four to six weeks, at which time the patient begins gait training.</p>\n\n<p>With the new prosthetic product, Chambers reduced the wait time between Slaughter’s fitting and the start of gait training to one week. He saw Slaughter in clinic on a Thursday in April and ordered supplies needed to make the prosthesis. Slaughter returned the following Thursday, where Chambers measured him and began to fabricate the prosthesis.</p>\n\n<p>Three hours later, the prosthesis was ready for Slaughter to use to begin gait training.</p>\n\n<p>“He arrived for his appointment at two and he was standing by five,” Chambers said. “It was really exciting for everyone. To do it in three hours is kind of flexing VA muscle.”</p>\n\n<p>Chambers supports Veterans who receive care at five VA medical centers throughout western Pennsylvania in VISN 4. He learned about the new product for below-the-knee amputations during a national VA training in March. After speaking with other VA prosthetists who implemented it in their clinics, Chambers was inspired to bring it home to VA Pittsburgh.</p>\n\n<p>“It seemed worth a shot, although there is a learning curve to this,” Chambers said.</p>\n\n<p>Chambers said VA Pittsburgh began to explore obtaining the new product months ago. He received strong backing from his department supervisors, as well as financial support to purchase a toolkit required to fit and fabricate the new prostheses.</p>\n\n<p>Manufacturing the Veteran’s prosthetic leg in house cost about $1,600, saving VA Pittsburgh more than $5,000 that would otherwise have been paid to a vendor for fabrication.</p>\n\n<p>“We already got our money back for it and I really appreciated that support from my boss,” Chambers said.</p>\n\n<p>Chambers and his colleagues anticipate expanding the technology to serve Veterans with above-the-knee amputations, as well.</p>\n\n<p>“I’m excited about this,” he said. “We’re looking forward to growing the orthotics and prosthetics clinic, hiring more support here in Pittsburgh and in the region, and becoming more self-sufficient.”</p>"

Everybody’s on edge. It’s exciting and people are really stepping up to the plate to make things work.”</p>\n\n<p>The new dialysis unit is also more convenient for Veterans – especially in winter – and saves on transportation costs. When VA drivers are unavailable, for instance, the cost for non-VA transportation services is $1,000 per round trip, said Van Buskirk.</p>\n\n<p>Palevsky sent plans to another VA medical center so it can develop a similar solution for its own patients.</p>\n\n<p>“Kudos to all the staff who are responsible for the remarkable feat of standing up this program in less than four weeks and to the entire dialysis unit staff,” said Palevsky.</p>"

There’s a camaraderie that you get between everybody in here because a majority of the people have gone through the same thing,” McClouds said.</p>\n\n<p>Three mornings a week you’ll find McClouds on the inpatient floors offering coffee to Veterans and their families. He has talked with hundreds of Veteran patients from all service eras and branches but has yet to meet another Veteran who served as a dog handler, as he did during the Vietnam War.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of people see my lanyard and ask, ‘Were you in the Air Force?’ and say, ‘Ah, you had it easy.’ And I say, ‘I was a dog handler.’ That was part of the Air Force that didn’t have it easy. We didn’t have it the worst, but we didn’t have the luxury that a lot of people in the Air Force had,” McClouds said.</p>\n\n<p>He became a handler shortly after his first assignment with security police at Lockbourne Air Force Base, Ohio. There, in 1969, he met a handler who told him that more handlers were needed because so many had deployed to Vietnam.</p>\n\n<p>“I said, ‘I love dogs.’ I’ve always had a dog … I put my name in, and they sent me to dog school,” McClouds said. “The Air Force didn’t care if you had qualifications. It was: ‘Do you want to get into it?’”</p>\n\n<p>McClouds had training at Lackland Air Force Base where he was assigned a dog and learned everything from basic obedience commands like “sit and stay” to wearing full-body padding and letting another handler’s dog attack him.</p>\n\n<p>In 1970 he deployed to Thailand’s Nakhon Phanom (NKP) Royal Thai Air Force Base, where he was paired with a German shepherd named Ted, aka Ted 6-O-M-6, for the serial number tattooed in its ear. </p>\n\n<p>“He was extremely aggressive -- very grouchy. But we loved each other,” McClouds recalls. “It took me seven days to even get into the kennel. I would sit outside for eight hours or longer. I’d call him up to the fence, and he’d want to rip me apart.”<br /><br />\nThree days into that first week McClouds was able to scratch Ted’s ear through the chain-link fence. By the seventh day he got a chain on the dog and let him run in the training area.</p>\n\n<p>“It was a big area … all fenced in. He just ran around and had the most glorious time.” McClouds said. “Then the first sergeant came out and asked me, ‘Where’s your dog?’ I told him in the training area, and he said, ‘That’s Ted. You’re never going to get him back.’”<br /><br />\nMcClouds did get Ted back, but it took four hours to get him chained and kenneled. A week later, McClouds was standing guard mount in the jungle outside of NPK with an AR-15 and Ted, one of the Vietnam War’s most lethal and important defensive weapons.</p>\n\n<p>“Our mission was to detect -- or stop -- anything from going in there. We would go out in the jungle and walk our designated sectors till something happened. Then we’d call central control, who would notify the perimeter patrol and dusty (helicopters) for their response and back up,” McClouds said.  <br /><br />\nHandlers also had to be wary of North Vietnamese sympathizers who could reap a handsome bounty for the tattooed ear of U.S. sentry dogs — and even more for a working dog’s collar.</p>\n\n<p>“I don’t want to take away from those troops who experienced heavy combat ... But I want people to know there was another line of defense out there that was the first line of defense on the bases,” McClouds said.</p>\n\n<p>After a year serving at NKP, McClouds returned to the states to finish his enlistment. Soon after, he learned that Ted had severely injured his next handler, resulting in the dog being euthanized.<br /><br />\n“These dogs were something to be afraid of because they were trained for only one thing, and that was to attack,” McClouds said. Still, he believes, many handlers, including himself, felt guilt for leaving their dogs behind. “At least in my case, that is something that will always bother me.”</p>\n\n<p>One bright spot for McClouds is the evolution in using military dogs. They are more specialized in the detection of explosives and drugs and can often be adopted by their handlers after their service.</p>\n\n<p>“There are so many other facets to these animals that we’ve overlooked. Now you see them as PTSD therapy dogs and service dogs. It’s like it’s right in front of your face. Most people like to see a dog -- it’s calming and it’s relaxing,” McClouds said.</p>\n\n<p><em>View more <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/VAPHS/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=10156854076141820\">photos on Facebook</a>.  </em></p>\n\n<p> <br />\nWriter’s Notes:<br />\n1. Lockbourne Air Force Base is now Rickenbacker Air National Guard Base.<br />\n2.  McClouds served with the 56th Special Police Squadron at NKP Royal Thai Air Force Base, which is now known as NKP Royal Thai Navy Base.<br />\n3. Lackland Air Force Base is now known as Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland.<br />\n4. Of the 4,000 dog handlers and dogs deployed to Vietnam, approximately 270 handlers and 500 dogs were killed in action, according to McClouds. McClouds is a member of the <a href=\"http://www.vdha.us/\">Vietnam Dog Handler Association</a>, which estimates less than 300 of the dogs used during the war returned to the U.S. Most dogs were either euthanized or transferred to South Vietnamese and Thai military.</p>"

For the past 22 years during the week before Memorial Day, he led the post's volunteers in placing U.S. flags on Veterans' graves in Pittsburgh-area Jewish cemeteries. He's turning that sacred duty over to another volunteer this year, but he remains committed to helping decorate the graves.</p>\n\n<p> \"I'll still be going,\" he said. \"As long as I can drive and walk and talk.\"</p>\n\n<p>Notovitz was among a group of members of the Pennsylvania Department of Military and Veterans Affairs who received <a href=\"https://www.multiplyinggood.org/\">Jefferson Awards</a> in 2014. Jefferson Awards are given at the national and local level to individuals and entities who put others before themselves.</p>\n\n<p>\"I got it for volunteering at the SW (Southwestern) Veterans Center and was nominated by the volunteer coordinator there,\" said Notovitz. \"I was there for 20 years and I got nominated there for the same things I do here. But I've been at VA Pittsburgh for 26 years.\"</p>\n\n<p>Notovitz can't say for certain exactly how many years he has been volunteering, but he got started as a way to help one of his Veteran friends.</p>\n\n<p>\"I started with a friend of mine who was a post commander,\" said Notovitz. \"He had a slight heart attack and asked me if I would come and help him here, and I've been here ever since.\"</p>\n\n<p>Notovitz now wants to nominate VAPHS recreation volunteers Ed and Mary Connell for a Jefferson Award. He says for all they do, they are more than deserving.</p>\n\n<p>\"They're here every morning from when the sun comes up until when the sun comes down,\" he said. \"They do so much around here, you can't believe it.\"</p>\n\n<p>Brad Krushinski, supervisor of the inpatient rehab clinic where Notovitz volunteers, has nothing but praise for him.</p>\n\n<p>\"He's a perfect example of the greatest generation,\" said Krushinski. \"I have the utmost respect for him, and he serves as an example for everyone here.\"</p>\n\n<p>Krushinski said Notovitz \"exemplifies what I want to be like when I get older. He's always thinking about other people. It's just refreshing to have him in this clinic and be such an example.

          "processed": "<p>The University of Pittsburgh's Department of Medicine invited Dr. Erin Brewer to Pittsburgh for its weekly <a href=\"http://dom.pitt.edu/grandrounds/\">Medicine Grand Rounds</a>. Brewer, who is medical director of the Women Veterans' Program at Southeast Louisiana Veterans Health Care System, New Orleans, discussed how her facility implemented VA's national End Harassment Campaign. The campaign began in 2017 with the goal of improving women's experiences using VA health care.</p>\n\n<p>Brewer described two crucial goals of the campaign: education and respect for women Veterans. Educational themes on campaign graphics include catch phrases such as, \"Catcalls: It's not a compliment. It's harassment,\" and a checklist of what is and what isn't acceptable to say or do at  VA. The respect component, launched in 2019, includes large-scale graphics showcasing women Veterans' service and accomplishments.  </p>\n\n<p>In one VA survey, Brewer said, 24% of respondents reported men harassed women, including through  cat-calling, ogling, propositioning, groping and questioning their Veteran status. That harassment is considered a major factor in lower rates of VA usage between women and men.</p>\n\n<p>More damaging, however, is that harassment is a threat to women's care and peace of mind. It causes some women Veterans to relive military sexual trauma or harassment, leading to their not using a well-deserved benefit of their service and sacrifice to the nation.</p>\n\n<p>\"They're thinking, 'Oh, I'm being harassed again—what's going to happen next,' or, 'I got enough of that (kind of treatment) in the military,'\" Brewer said.</p>\n\n<p>Women are the fastest growing demographic of Veterans and military service members. Women using VA health care currently make up 8% of VA patients, and that number is expected to rise to nearly 20% over the next ten years.* </p>\n\n<p>Brewer described for the private-sector audience of interns, residents and other health care providers how trauma-informed care can improve patient trust and comfort in health care settings. Trauma-informed care prompts health care providers to consider the sobering statistics about how many people — and not just service members — have experienced a major physical or psychological trauma.</p>\n\n<p>\"We just don't understand the relationship between resilience and trauma. We know it takes a very long time to change the culture (in institutions), but (ending harassment) is the right thing to do. It's right for the mission and right for business,\" Brewer said.</p>\n\n<p>In New Orleans, Brewer said efforts to improve the environment for women include all-staff education, bystander intervention training, feedback surveys, and changing interior design so that women who enter don't feel like they're walking through a gauntlet or being watched or threatened.</p>\n\n<p>\"We need to be conscious of our mission, have compassion and kindness, and train seriously and often,\" Brewer said.</p>\n\n<p><em>*VA estimates an increase in female patients based on an increasing number of women in the military. </em></p>"

His wife kept asking him the same question, he said, but he couldn't \"formulate an answer, everything went blank.\" Though they sought immediate medical attention, Baxter lost the power of language and right-side mobility.</p>\n\n<p>\"I spent 10 days in the hospital and eight weeks in rehab — just to learn the basics…I focused on two seemingly simple things: physical mobility and speech,\" Baxter said.</p>\n\n<p>His communication problems came from aphasia, a condition that impairs one's ability to understand, speak, read and write.</p>\n\n<p>\"I took on every opportunity,\" Baxter said. \"Time is brain. The longer you wait to start rehabbing, the harder it is for it to return.\"</p>\n\n<p>In 2018, Baxter published \"Relentless: How a Massive Stroke Changed My Life for the Better,\" a book detailing his journey after his stroke. In it, he also writes about his recovery and how his stroke changed his life priorities. </p>\n\n<p>Baxter's story and advocacy for stroke survivors are both reasons VA Pittsburgh invited him to speak.</p>\n\n<p>Strokes are a major concern for Veterans, especially males, who have an 81% higher risk of stroke than their non-Veteran male counterparts, according to Dr. Patrick Doyle, founding director of VA Pittsburgh's Program for Intensive Residential Aphasia Treatment and Education (<a href=\"https://www.va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care/programs/pirate-program-for-intensive-residential-aphasia-treatment-education/\">PIRATE</a>).</p>\n\n<p>\"We have an exceptional aphasia recovery and research program here,\" Doyle said. \"More than 158 Veterans from 34 states have gone through it. Having Ted share his philosophy, recovery and advocacy efforts will only motivate and give hope to our Veterans — and others -- who are recovering from a stroke.\"</p>\n\n<p>PIRATE gives Veterans (and active-duty service members) five weeks of one-on-one speech language treatment and personalized aphasia education. The program also supports and encourages Veterans to become self-advocates for increasing aphasia awareness in their communities.</p>\n\n<p>\"People need to know that recovery from aphasia can occur for years following its onset given targeted and intensive intervention,\" Doyle said. \"PIRATE is the only intensive treatment program for aphasia in the VA system and one of only a handful in the U.S.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"One of our goals is to show that aphasia treatment has the possibility to bring someone with severe aphasia up to the level of what Ted is doing. We applaud him,\" Doyle said.</p>\n\n<p>Further goals, Doyle said, are to reduce the incidence of stroke through public awareness and education regarding key risk factors, improved self-management of hypertension, cholesterol and smoking.</p>\n\n<p>After his presentation, Baxter led a Q&amp;A with Doyle and <a href=\"https://slhs.arizona.edu/person/audrey-holland-phd\">Dr. Audrey Holland</a>, a noted aphasiologist and Doyle's graduate school mentor. </p>\n\n<p>Baxter finished his presentation by giving out 70 signed copies of his book to survivors and providers, all purchased by the VRFP.</p>"

Not more than 15 minutes before the treatment started, Stanford had told acupuncturist Amanda Federovich that the pain in her buttocks was a 10 on the zero to 10 scale – the worst pain she could imagine.<br /><br />\nIt was this pain that kept her up the night before, ruined her mood for the morning and put her under a lot of stress. Stanford had kept to a regimen of narcotic painkillers, analgesics, benzodiazepines, kinesthesia and music therapy. Nothing had really worked until today.<br /><br />\nAnd all it took was five tiny needles inserted gently in each ear.<br /><br />\n\"I was elated that Nadine was pain free by the end of the session,\" Federovich said. \"Her daily life is a struggle due to pain from her contractures, spasms and wounds. It is very overwhelming to see her that happy and relaxed.\"<br /><br />\nAlthough Stanford had the best possible outcome, battlefield acupuncture doesn't always work in the same way for different people.<br /><br />\n\"The average response to BFA is a 2.2-point reduction in pain (on a scale from 0-10) from pre- to post- session,\" said Federovich. \"With that being an average, some Veterans have a more significant pain reduction response than others. Having total pain relief is the best-case scenario.\"<br /><br />\nFederovich, a certified registered nurse practitioner, is the first clinician at VA Pittsburgh to be certified in battlefield acupuncture, a specialized subset of acupuncture. BFA was designed to be used in wartime with treatments only in the ear as a representation for the whole body.<br /><br />\nThere are five points on the ear that represent certain areas of the body. By confining the technique to the ear, practitioners can work in battlefield environments where a service member's entire body is not ready for treatment. Currently, the U.S. Air Force has their own certification for battlefield acupuncture that can be used in the field.<br /><br />\nWhen the needles go in, Federovich said, there is a small pinch and then the patient usually feels a sense of relaxation. A needle is put in one point of one ear and then the same point in the other ear until the patient says they feel better.<br /><br />\nStanford said she didn't feel the needles. Every time a set was placed in, Federovich asked Stanford to move her arms and hands. With every placement, Stanford found it easier to move them. Every time Stanford was asked if she wanted the treatment to continue, she responded with an enthusiastic \"oh yeah,\" or \"yes ma'am!<br /><br />\nBattlefield acupuncture, as well as the standard acupuncture available at VA Pittsburgh, is a key component of the whole health movement, which concentrates on outcomes the Veteran wants for their life and arranges care to meet those outcomes.<br /><br />\n\"It's really a great component of whole health,\" said Federovich. \"We're empowering our Veterans to be an active participant in their health care. Things like chronic pain, anxiety, PTSD, these are things that battlefield acupuncture can address so the Veterans are not dependent on meds.\"<br /><br />\nThere's already more Veterans eager to try out BFA and Federovich's continuing mission is to train other providers to do what she does.<br /><br />\n\"I am eager to roll BFA out to the rest of the facility,\" said Federovich. \"I am hopeful that other Veterans will have similar responses and improve their quality of life.\"<br /><br />\nEditor's note: If you think battlefield acupuncture might benefit you, talk with your VA provider.</p>"

She was also among the first in the nation to join the service – just three months earlier, on July 30, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had <a href=\"https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/nhhc/browse-by-topic/diversity/women-in-the-navy/waves-world-war-ii.html\">signed the law establishing the corps.</a><br /><br />\n\"I had a good job with the school, but I felt I would be doing more for my country by being in the service,\" said Simon.<br /><br />\nThe seventh of 12 children, Simon said she chose the Navy because several of her brothers were already serving in the Army, Air Force and Coast Guard.<br /><br />\n\"They were all enlisted, and I thought, well, what's wrong with joining the Navy?\" said Simon. \"I decided I wanted to go, and I was accepted.\"<br /><br />\nSimon <a href=\"https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=WA049\">attended WAVES Naval Station Training at Oklahoma A&amp;M College (now Oklahoma State University)</a> in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Each class of 1,250 yeoman learned military discipline, march and drill, and naval history over a six to eight-week training period.<br /><br />\n\"That's where we learned the basics of the Navy,\" said Simon. \"We were trained to march, we studied hard, and they drilled into us how important what we were doing was.\"</p>\n\n<p>After completing basic, many of the WAVES trainees spent another 12 weeks at the college for advanced training in secretarial duties.<br /><br />\nFrom Oklahoma, Simon was assigned to active duty at the <a href=\"https://navyyard.org/about-the-campus/history\">Philadelphia Naval Shipyard</a>, which during World War II employed 40,000, built 53 warships and repaired another 1,218. She and her fellow yeomen earned anywhere from <a href=\"https://www.history.navy.mil/our-collections/art/exhibits/conflicts-and-operations/wwii/recruiting-posters-for-women/what-pay-does-a-navy-wave-get.html\">$50 to $125 in basic pay per month</a>, depending on their rank, plus food and quarters allowance, unless provided by the Navy. <br /><br />\nSimon said she was assigned to live on the all-female fourth floor of the Benjamin Franklin Hotel in Philadelphia, where WAVES personnel were under strict orders not to visit any other floors of the hotel – an order Simon said she followed.<br /><br />\n\"I didn't go on the other floors,\" said Simon, sternly. \"It was none of my business.\"<br /><br />\nSimon's military responsibilities included taking dictation from the officer in charge, performing clerical duties and driving officers around the base.<br /><br />\n\"They gave me a driver's license for the Navy, and I would drive these officers, sometimes just very short distances,\" Simon said, smiling as she motioned from her seat at a dining room table to the far side of her kitchen. \"I thought that was interesting because it would have done them some good if they'd just walked.\"<br /><br />\nSimon wrote letters home to her family at first, then sent her parents money to have a home phone installed. Home phones were a luxury at the time – Simon said before the phone was installed, her family used a telephone at a nearby store to call her.<br /><br />\n\"I sent them money every payday to keep the phone bill paid,\" Simon said. \"It was much easier to call than to sit down and write, especially since I was writing all day at the office.\"<br /><br />\nThe phone also allowed her future husband, Joseph \"Joe\" Simon, to keep in touch with her. The two had met at the high school where Joe Simon worked as an agriculture teacher, and he'd visit with her when she was home on leave. They married in July 1945, just a few weeks before Melva Simon was honorably discharged from the Navy in August 1945.<br /><br />\nThe couple purchased a 22-acre farm in 1947 in Mt. Pleasant Township, Pennsylvania, where they supplemented Joe's teacher's salary by growing and selling sweet corn.<br /><br />\n\"It sold like hot fire because it was good sweet corn,\" Melva Simon said. \"Then Joe planted apple trees, and that's what we decided to do.\"<br /><br />\nThe couple started an apple orchard – <a href=\"http://simonsorchard.com/\">Simon's Apple Orchard</a> – that remains family-run today. The orchard opens its doors to customers every fall, offering everything from pure sweet cider still made using the Simons' original recipe to bags of fresh McIntosh, Stayman, Rome, Jonathan, red and yellow delicious, and other apple varieties.<br /><br />\nStill spry at 102, Melva Simon worked the orchard alongside her husband and took over when he died in 2004 at the age of 88. Up until just a few years ago, she drove tractors, harvested apples, made cider and worked the counter at a small shop on the property.<br /><br />\nBlessed with a lifetime of good health, Melva Simon only recently discovered she is eligible for health care benefits through the Department of Veterans Affairs. With the help of her daughter, Melvajo Bennett, the World War II Veteran since August has received care through VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System's <a href=\"https://www.pittsburgh.va.gov/locations/westmoreland.asp\">Westmoreland County VA Outpatient Clinic</a>.<br /><br />\n\"It didn't dawn on her to go to the VA because she's always had such good health and never really had to see the doctor,\" said Bennett. \"But they've been wonderful, with how they are treating her.\" <br /><br />\nAsked for the secret to good health and a long life, Melva Simon gave a simple answer.<br /><br />\n\"There is no secret,\" she said. \"All it takes is simple living. I eat simple food. I don't drink, and I don't smoke.\"<br /><br />\nAs for her military service, Melva Simon said she'd do it all over again.<br /><br />\n\"That was all I ever wanted to do, was to do something for the government and the country,\" she said. \"I'd do it again.\"</p>"

Heinz III campus. He served in the U.S. Navy during World War II as a steward and steward's mate. He was stationed in the Philippines with the 7th Fleet during the Philippine liberation.<br /><br />\nHis family has never seen a formal picture of him in uniform from his service in the Navy and expressed their sincere wish to be able to see their dad in uniform. His own was stolen during his return trip home in 1946.<br /><br />\n\"We just wanted a picture of my dad, and we mentioned it to Rose (Hernandez),\" said Ely's youngest daughter, Lisa Ely. \"I told Rose, someone said there's a place where you can get uniforms of Veterans. She said let me ask around. We just wanted the uniform to take a picture of Dad.\"<br /><br />\nHernandez thought at first this would be an impossible wish to grant but worked on it with Margaret Felkay and Soldiers &amp; Sailors Memorial Hall, which collects American military uniforms and artifacts.<br /><br />\n\"We occasionally get a collector who donates uniforms with no name attached to them, no history of the uniform,\" said Lisa Petitta, the hall's collection manager. \"We put those aside in case we get special requests. When Margaret called and asked if we would be able to help, my first reaction was, I will try my best.\"<br /><br />\nPetitta used a copy of Ely's DD Form 214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty) to locate an appropriate uniform and personalize it with the correct service ribbons.<br /><br />\n\"Details few will know, but we will,\" said Richard Laufer, associate chief nurse at VA Pittsburgh and a Soldiers &amp; Sailors board member. Laufer hand-delivered the DD-214 copy to Petitta.<br /><br />\nAll the effort and coordination came together late in August at the H.J. Heinz III campus Learning eXchange.</p>\n\n<p>Felkay picked up the Navy uniform from Soldiers &amp; Sailors. VA Pittsburgh photographer Bill George set up a makeshift photo studio – complete with lights, a black backdrop and flags – in the Learning eXchange. Hernandez escorted Mager Ely and his family – daughters Betty Turner and Lisa Ely and granddaughter Keshona Beasley – to the Learning eXchange. Several VA Pittsburgh staff members and leaders were on hand to welcome the family.<br /><br />\n\"When you opened the door, I saw the American flag and Navy flag, and you guys standing there,\" said Lisa Ely. \"I thought this is so official, it's so big. The flags made it all perfect. I couldn't hold my tears back. It was a life-changing event.\"<br /><br />\nEly's nurse and his daughters helped him don the 1940s-era blue, wool Navy service jumper and cap. A staff member brought a full-length mirror into the room and when Ely saw himself, he pointed toward his reflection and smiled.</p>\n\n<p>Once positioned under the lights and in between the flags, Ely sang softly and chuckled as the photographer worked to capture his personality. Joined by his daughters for a series of photos, Ely spontaneously raised his arms, prompting joyful laughter.<br /><br />\nEly's daughters said their father hasn't received much recognition for his military service, and they felt he truly appreciated the gesture. <br /><br />\n\"We showed him the pictures later that night and he was smiling,\" said Turner.<br /><br />\n\"He wants to know he is still a person,\" said Lisa Ely.<br /><br />\nEly's family members weren't the only ones touched the day of the photo shoot.<br /><br />\nLaufer said helping Mager Ely made his \"heart feel good.\"<br /><br />\nLisa Petitta could not attend the photo shoot in person but received live updates via text messaging. She said the event made her year.<br /><br />\nFelkay said she understands first-hand the importance of seeing a loved one in his or her military uniform.<br /><br />\n\"Although we can't do this for every Vet, I felt bad that his family never saw him in uniform,\" said Felkay. \"My dad is a Vet and I grew up seeing him in uniform, and I know how special that is.\"<br /><br />\nLisa Ely described the photo shoot as a beautiful ceremony. <br /><br />\n\"It was meant to be a photoshoot and ended up as a true-blue ceremony,\" she said. \"It gave you something warm in your stomach, it's a feeling I don't want to ever leave me. But even if the feeling leaves, I have pictures that are forever mine. Not just the pictures because now it's in my heart. I feel like I walk with my father now; I walked a part of his life with him.\"</p>"

Researchers at VA's National Center for PTSD in a 2015 study found that with time, aging combat Veterans revisit their wartime memories to find meaning and build coherence.</p>\n\n<p>Since the training began in June, VA Pittsburgh has trained 77 non-VA staff in community facilities, including physicians, executive directors, social workers, nurses, volunteers, coordinators and chaplains.</p>\n\n<p>Dave Fox, a VA Pittsburgh social worker who served in the Army, says he is comforted knowing that VA Pittsburgh is engaging the community to help Vietnam and Vietnam-era Veterans in end-of-life or palliative care.</p>\n\n<p> \"As a social worker and employee at VA Pittsburgh, I have found a greater sense of confidence and meaningfulness in my work with this initiative in place,\" Fox said. \"And not only do the providers and Veterans benefit from this program, but Veteran's family members also benefit.\"</p>\n\n<p>Fox said the initiative helps families better understand \"what the Veterans are going through.\" It also  encourages providers to work together to meet Veterans' overall needs, said Deborah Goral, VA Pittsburgh's palliative care health system specialist.</p>\n\n<p>\"This initiative is much more than just training professionals,\" said Goral. \"It's about collaborating with the community to identify departments, programs and services that best support Veterans and their families as they walk through a serious illness.\"</p>\n\n<p>Vietnam Veterans represent the largest group of American Veterans in terms of service era: Roughly 2.7 million American men and women served in the Vietnam War.</p>\n\n<p>VA's Palliative and Hospice Care Program awarded VA Pittsburgh and each of the 19 other facilities $30,000 in funding to implement the initiative. The funding supported \"train-the-trainer\" training: VA staff were trained to train community providers in PTSD, moral injury and suicide prevention specifically designed for Vietnam-era Veterans on hospice. Moving forward, VA Pittsburgh plans to continue to offer the training and expand it with simulated patients.</p>\n\n<p>For more information on the initiative, contact Deborah Goral at <a href=\"mailto:deborah.goral@va.gov\">deborah.goral@va.gov</a> or 412-360-1984.</p>"

The technology, Grindle said, has come a long way.</p>\n\n<p>\"Our first 3D printer had some significant limitations on the types of material it could use, but the potential was clearly there,\" Grindle said. \"Over time, machines and materials got better. We went from making maybe a few hundred basic plastic parts a year to making several thousand plastic parts, many of high complexity.\"</p>\n\n<p>HERL has been a leader in using 3D printing technology, helping to spread the technology to VA facilities nationwide and in training the next generation of 3D print users.</p>\n\n<p>\"Some of the first rehab engineers within the VA to use 3D printing parts in assistive technology clinics have been HERL alumni,\" Grindle said. \"They were strong advocates for spreading these technologies to other VA assistive technology clinics and creating the national network.</p>\n\n<p>\"We've trained hundreds of people in this technology: students, vocational trainees, staff and faculty. 3D printers are easy to operate and a good starting point for introducing people to manufacturing.\"</p>\n\n<p>While it can take years to master designing parts for 3D printers, the operation of the machines can be taught in several weeks.</p>\n\n<p>\"We teach people the theory behind the machines, how to operate them, and good design practices for making parts on 3D printers.\"</p>"

Through their daily service, VA’s 100,000+ nurses make lasting improvements in the quality of care Veterans receive at more than 1,250 facilities around the nation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here’s is just one story about how VA nurses excel in their occupation, on and off duty.</strong></p>\n\n<p>VA Nurse Karen Brodlo (pictured above) sat in a restaurant enjoying her dinner when she heard someone yell to call 911.</p>\n\n<p>She looked up to see an elderly woman had collapsed and was not breathing. The woman was having dinner with her husband when the night took a turn for the worst.</p>\n\n<p>Brodlo quickly jumped in action. As a VA nurse for 23 years and in the nursing field since 1969, it was second nature. She identified herself to the crowd as a nurse and assessed the situation.  Right away she noticed that the woman was positioned incorrectly.  She quickly made the adjustments and started to administer CPR.</p>\n\n<p>She continued manual CPR process until the rescue team arrived. She then turned her focus to the husband who was nervous and scared for his wife’s well-being. She tried to calm him down as the rescue team continued to work to save the woman’s life.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>She later suggested to the restaurant that a general-use defibrillator would be a useful addition. </em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>She remembers the worst part being, not having the equipment she needed. She suggested to the restaurant after the incident that a general-use defibrillator would be a useful addition.  Just as most businesses have fire extinguishers, a defibrillator should also be a requirement. Just as easy to use, it’s better to have and not need it than to need it and not have it.</p>\n\n<p>After much praise came her way for saving a life, Brodlo said, “I just did what was right. No accolades are needed for doing my job.”</p>\n\n<p>The restaurant now gives her star treatment. The daughter of the woman she saved sent a bouquet of flowers along with a heartfelt thank you card calling Brodlo her mom’s “Guardian Angel.”</p>\n\n<p>Brodlo is a nurse at the Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center in North Chicago.</p>\n\n<p>As a caring nurse who adores her job, she followed up on the status of her honorary patient. Sadly, a couple of weeks after the incident, the woman passed away from further complications, but the family was overwhelming grateful.</p>\n\n<p>The last days with any family member or loved one is crucial. If it wasn’t for the quick actions of nurse Karen Brodlo, they would have missed out on the opportunity to say their last goodbye.</p>"

Heinz III campus can literally breathe a sigh of relief with the addition of same-day pulmonary function tests (PFTs).</p>\n\n<p>Anticipated to begin in November, same-day PFTs will ease time and travel commitments and reduce delays for Veterans seeking disability benefits. C&amp;P currently schedules medical exam and PFT appointments separately.</p>\n\n<p>\"That's potentially two trips to the VA, two times struggling to find parking, two times figuring out how to get to the clinic to be seen and two times stressing about whether the evaluation is going to go smoothly,\" said senior C&amp;P examiner, Georgia Brinit-Stiffler.</p>\n\n<p>\"We can do better for these Veterans,\" said Brinit-Stiffler, a nurse practitioner who proposed the same-day tests in December. \"And with the support of VA's Innovators Network, we will.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Spark-Seed-Spread Innovation Investment Program helped Brinit-Stiffler develop her \"All In One Breath\" idea and acquire equipment for the tests.

Talking is the healthiest way of beginning to deal with grief, especially when the pain seems too much to bear. Skilled VA Pittsburgh professionals such as psychotherapists and chaplains can help you process your grief.</p>\n\n<p>Grief impacts your mind, emotions, body and spirit. It has been said \"grief is about a broken heart, not a broken brain.\" We all grieve differently.

At VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, an all-volunteer team of experts provides medical and psychological care to transgender Veterans throughout the VISN 4 service area.</p>\n\n<p>Under the direction of clinical psychologist Dawnelle Paldino, VA Pittsburgh's 26-member Interdisciplinary Transgender Treatment Team provides gender transition counseling, hormone therapy evaluations, speech and other therapies. Psychologists determine the appropriate time to refer Veterans for gender affirming surgery, but VA does not perform or pay for the surgery.</p>\n\n<p>\"I cannot express just how grateful I am to be part of this team, to be working alongside such dedicated and knowledgeable individuals, and to have received support and trust from facility leadership, department chiefs and VAPHS employees,\" said Paldino.</p>\n\n<p>Team member and social worker Sarah Merlina said VA's efforts to serve transgender Veterans started five years ago, when VA Central Office streamlined its formal guidance on transgender and intersex care for Veterans. By 2016, every VA medical center was required to have at least one LGBT Veteran care coordinator.</p>\n\n<p>\"Coordinators serve as a point of contact and advocate for LGBT Veterans, helping to ensure access to any needed VA care,\" said Merlina. \"They also help educate other VA staff regarding available services and provide a welcoming environment to all Veterans.\"</p>\n\n<p>The team includes specialists in primary care medicine, endocrinology, nursing, social work, psychology, psychiatry, pharmacy, speech pathology, creative arts therapy and spirituality. Asked why they volunteered, team members stressed inclusiveness and a desire to help an underserved Veteran population.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Molly Fisher, a women's health fellow, said she knew immediately she wanted to be on VA Pittsburgh's transgender treatment team.</p>\n\n<p>\"I don't think we learn enough about transgender medicine in medical school, so I was excited to jump on the chance to be on this team,\" said Fisher. \"I'm also creating training for primary care physicians to provide comprehensive transgender care.\"</p>\n\n<p>Most Veterans seeking transgender services initially visit primary care.</p>\n\n<p>Fisher said much of her work is to refer to the transgender team all Veterans who ask about transitioning. She said it's important for health care providers to understand the transgender population's primary care issues so patients receive appropriate screenings and health care.  Veterans who wish to transition also meet with behavioral health clinicians to make sure they are ready for transition.</p>\n\n<p>Psychology fellow Dr. Joanna Hayward, Ph.D., is part of the clinician team assessing Veterans.</p>\n\n<p>\"We're looking at psycho-social factors to see if people are eligible to receive cross-sex hormone therapy at the VA,\" said Hayward. \"These factors include their history, risk conditions for hormones, a mental health assessment and whether they have social support.\"</p>\n\n<p>Hayward said VA Pittsburgh also provides individual therapy for issues that come up with gender identity and LGBT status, social and otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>Hormone therapy is a key factor in transition and levels must be carefully monitored, according to endocrinologist Dr. Ronald Codario.</p>\n\n<p>\"My main clinical responsibility is hormonal therapy, checking lab work, discussing patient goals, forming a treatment plan and making adjustments to it based on the patient's treatment goals and lab levels,\" said Codario.</p>\n\n<p>Codario said it's important the team coordinate all aspects of care to ensure Veterans who are transitioning stay on track.  For instance, psychologists help determine the appropriate time to refer patients to speech and recreational therapy, laser hair removal or gender affirming surgical therapy, if desired.</p>\n\n<p>\"There's a lot of coordination with providers on the team, especially psychologists and our clinical pharmacist, who troubleshoots medications,\" said Codario. \"We discuss with the psychologists when it's time to refer patients to speech and recreational therapy, laser hair removal and if the patient is pursuing it, gender affirming surgical therapy.\"</p>\n\n<p>While VA does not perform or pay for gender affirming surgery, it does provide guidance, according to Merlina.</p>\n\n<p>\"We can provide necessary documentation, pre-op work-ups, and/or post-op care for gender affirming surgeries,\" said Merlina.  \"Our treatment team also tries to keep a running list of surgeons and providers in the community that Veterans can reach out to or consult with regarding surgery options.\"</p>\n\n<p>Pharmacists play a key role, advising endocrinologists on medications available at VA and how to administer and monitor them, said Amanda McQuillan, the team's clinical pharmacist.</p>\n\n<p>\"I also help both VA Pittsburgh and patients from local clinics get their medications. I guess you can say I'm kind of a troubleshooter when patients need refills or a medication we may not have in stock.\"</p>\n\n<p>McQuillan also educates other VA pharmacists on the use of hormones and off-label medications in transgender therapy.</p>\n\n<p>\"This is so when they get a prescription, they know how to process it and what to look for,\" she said.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most interesting positions on the team is the speech pathologist. Ronda Winans-Mitrik said speech mannerisms are vitally important for Veterans in transition.</p>\n\n<p>\"A big part of my work is educating and training Veterans on how to make their male voice more feminine and on safe-voice modification,\" said Winans-Mitrik. \"Individuals using masculinizing hormone therapy will achieve a lowering of their voice as a result of the hormones. In individuals seeking feminization, female hormones do not cause the voice to change.\"</p>\n\n<p>For men who are transitioning, it's not just the voice. Pitch is one aspect, but Winans-Mitrik said it's also about feminizing their own communication style.</p>\n\n<p>\"Females have a different melody to their voice, such as rising intonations when asking questions,\" said Winans-Mitrik. \"We teach them the feminizations of coughing and laughing, and also their physical actions – how to sit as a woman does or talk with her hands.\"</p>\n\n<p>The team also educates VA Pittsburgh staff and students and interns from area colleges and universities, said Merlina.</p>\n\n<p>For Paldino, the program fulfills VA's promise to care for every Veteran – and that means every Veteran.</p>\n\n<p>\"Personally, I feel so honored and fortunate to be able to give so much of my attention and time to serving transgender Veterans, to get to know them, learn from them, and be a part of meeting their needs,\" Paldino said. \"Acceptance of all and helping to promote others' potential and development to become who they truly are is deeply important to me.\"</p>\n\n<p>For more information on transgender care at VA Pittsburgh, contact Kristen Lyons at 412-360-6645.</p>"

In a game of paper hoops, for instance, he and his brothers would toss crumpled paper into a garbage can to see who had the best aim.</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward to adulthood and working at VA Pittsburgh's now-closed Highland Drive campus. Charlton occasionally shot paper hoops while on breaks at work and soon noticed patients picking up on it, too.</p>\n\n<p>\"Next thing you know, somebody came up to me and said, 'think I can make it from here?'\" Charlton said.</p>\n\n<p>He noticed Veterans began entertaining themselves with light-hearted games of paper hoops instead of watching television in the day room.</p>\n\n<p>\"One day at home I was just watching TV when the idea popped in my head of an actual game,\" Charlton said. \"The Veterans were shooting in the garbage can so often as an unofficial game, I thought it would be cool to come up with an actual basketball-oriented game.\"</p>\n\n<p>Charlton brainstormed ideas for resources: a hoop, a ball, jerseys.</p>\n\n<p>\"It ended up taking over a year to develop it, with rules and everything,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>Charlton continued to work on the idea after VA Pittsburgh relocated from Highland Drive to University Drive in Oakland.

The idea is simple: two teams compete against one another by answering trivia questions covering a range of topics from movies, music, sports and politics to questions relating to their stay at VA Pittsburgh.</p>\n\n<p>Each question has a different point value.</p>\n\n<p>\"Important questions dealing with mental health and other issues are 50-point questions, not just 2,\" Charlton said. \"Those are usually bonus questions that we try to slide in during the fourth quarter for some learning while we're playing.\"</p>\n\n<p>When a team answers a question correctly on its turn, one of its members gets a chance to shoot a hoop for the points. If a team answers a question incorrectly, the other team gets a chance to answer and earn a chance to shoot a hoop. The game lasts multiple rounds, sometimes including a tie-breaker round, until one team wins.</p>\n\n<p>Games are usually played every Friday between two six-player teams called The Pittsburgh Special Forces and The Pittsburgh Sharp Shooters. Any inpatient Veteran on the unit can join in the fun. Many patients enjoy playing, according to Charlton and his fellow staff members, but even those who don't participate enjoy watching.</p>\n\n<p>Every player gets to wear a jersey during the competition, something Charlton has worked hard to guarantee. The first jerseys were personally made by a staff member in Voluntary Service.</p>\n\n<p>\"We still use those every once in a while for a throwback game,\" said Charlton. Moving forward, staff in Voluntary Service are helping obtain funds for electronic scoreboards and a third set of jerseys.</p>\n\n<p>Charlton has seen Veterans thrive as they practice teamwork and group participation.</p>\n\n<p>\"The game benefits them in every way you can think,\" said Charlton. \"It also benefits the whole unit and can change the atmosphere on the unit. Some Veterans even forget they are here in the hospital because they're into the game so much.\"</p>\n\n<p>Jonathan Heshler, a behavioral health nurse manager who has worked with Charlton on the unit for many years, said the game makes a noticeable, positive difference for Veteran inpatients.</p>\n\n<p>Another benefit is simply the physical aspect of getting up and shooting the ball, according to Charlton. Patients in wheelchairs also play and will stand up momentarily or shoot from their wheelchair.</p>\n\n<p>\"The group is more cohesive, there's more camaraderie and the Veterans look forward to it,\" said Charlton. \"They're enjoying the game and trying to answer questions. It gets competitive.\"</p>\n\n<p>TVs in the area are turned off during the game and afterward for a while. The atmosphere is noticeably calmer during this time, say staff.</p>\n\n<p>\"After the game is over, there's a sense of relief following a burst of energy, with everyone chilling and relaxing,\" Charlton said. \"That goes for me, too.\"</p>\n\n<p>Hoops 4 Troops marked its fifth anniversary game on Feb. 13, 2019.</p>\n\n<p>\"This activity is truly amazing,\" said Richard Laufer, associate chief nurse for the behavioral health unit. \"It engages challenging patients, is therapeutic and assists with developing social interactions skills. Mr. Charlton's ability to engage Veterans in this activity is truly remarkable.\"</p>"

          "processed": "<p>September’s I CARE Award winners, registered nurse Sandra Koontz and medical support assistant (MSA) Ashley Sams, helped a Veteran who was homeless get transportation to our University Drive medical center in Pittsburgh’s Oakland neighborhood.  The Veteran needed medications for severe physical problems. When he was unable to obtain them from a community provider’s emergency department, he contacted Koontz in Community Care to see if he could come to VA for care.  Since the Veteran is not service-connected, he was ineligible for transportation to the medical center. Undeterred, Koontz reached out to colleague Sams, an MSA in Community Care who is familiar with transportation options for disabled Veterans. Sams gave the Veteran directions to the nearest DAV van pickup location, the van’s schedule, and documentation he would have to provide to ride with DAV. Using that information, the Veteran obtained a ride to University Drive the following day, where he received the care and medication he needed.</p>\n\n<p>October’s I CARE Award winner, radiation therapist Patricia Meneskie, helped a Veteran with a history of behavioral health outbursts through 33 very difficult treatments for head and neck cancer. Meneskie took care to always treat the Veteran with respect and compassion, spoke calmly to him, and went out of her way to make him laugh. She volunteered to provide the Veteran with his daily treatments because she knew he enjoyed her kindness, humor, compassion and dedication to excellent care. With Meneskie’s help, the Veteran finished all treatments and follow-up appointments. Although the Veteran has since died, Meneskie made certain that when he was receiving his treatments, he knew that she – and everyone in VA Pittsburgh’s radiation therapy department – loved and cared for him.<br /><br />\nNovember’s I CARE Award winner, housekeeping aide James Northcutt, showed empathy and poise when he helped calm a distressed Veteran patient. While working on 5 West at University Drive, Northcutt overheard a Veteran patient berating a nurse. Northcutt quickly stepped in to assist. He spoke calmly but firmly with the Veteran to de-escalate the situation. His efforts ensured staff did not have to call a code for assistance for a behavioral health incident.</p>\n\n<p>December’s I CARE Award winners, nursing assistants Sandra D. Yavoich, Lloyd C. Adams and Lester R. Williams, worked as a team to save a Veteran’s life. While checking on patients during rounding, Yavoich approached a Veteran who was seated in a wheelchair in his room to ask him if he needed assistance. When the Veteran didn’t answer, Yavoich noticed he wasn’t breathing. She immediately notified nursing staff to initiate a code for cardiac/respiratory arrest. Adams and Williams responded to the code and immediately began chest compressions and CPR, successfully resuscitating the Veteran.</p>\n\n<p>January’s I CARE award winners, social worker Samantha Gyory and Public Affairs Chief Kathleen Pomorski, assisted Veterans in unrelated situations that required quick action.</p>\n\n<p>Gyory was on her way home from work at University Drive when she noticed a Veteran near the pharmacy area bleeding from cut wrists. Gyory immediately jumped into action, taking the Veteran to the Emergency Department and staying with the individual for several hours until admitted. Her selfless actions, along with her daily commitment to respecting and serving all Veterans, embodies VA’s I Care core values.</p>\n\n<p>Pomorski quickly stepped in to help a Veteran determine on short notice if he could have a medical procedure performed at VA. The Veteran called Pomorski for help because he discovered just days before he was to undergo the procedure at a non-VA facility that he could no longer afford the costs. Pomorski reached out to the appropriate contacts to save the Veteran from committing to an unaffordable surgery. Pomorski continues to advocate for Veterans, offering her expert advice and help whenever needed.</p>"

          "processed": "<p>The Belmont County VA Outpatient Clinic in March 2019 moved to a larger, more modern space two miles away from its previous location, but remains in St. Clairsville, Ohio. Now in the Ohio Valley Mall at 67800 Mall Ring Road, near Sears, the 16,000-square-foot clinic:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Is nearly twice as large as the former clinic</li>\n\t<li>Offers four times as much space for virtual care appointments for mental health and other specialty care</li>\n\t<li>Adds hearing tests and hearing aid maintenance and repair and some dermatology services</li>\n\t<li>Provides all the same services available at the former location including primary, preventive, women's and mental health care; dietary, laboratory and imaging services; prescription drug benefits; and social work</li>\n\t<li>Has ample parking, more handicapped spaces and is located along a public transit bus route</li>\n</ul><p>More than 5,100 Veterans receive care annually at the Belmont County outpatient clinic, and VA Pittsburgh expects that number to grow. Veterans and their families who toured the new space during the grand opening gave it high marks.</p>\n\n<p>\"They needed the space,\" said Army Veteran Glen E. Burkhead Jr. as he and his son, Glen E. Burkhead III, both of Barnesville, Ohio, toured the clinic. \"There is a lot more room here. You almost need a road map to get through here.\"</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Ali Sonel, VA Pittsburgh's chief of staff, said the state-of-the-art outpatient clinic reflects VA's commitment to ensuring Veterans receive the highest quality health care available at locations convenient to them.</p>\n\n<p>\"VA provides Veterans with exceptional care close to home at outpatient clinics located in the heart of America, small cities and communities like St. Clairsville,\" Sonel said. \"Veterans earned and deserve convenient access to VA health care – ranging from advanced therapies for health needs unique to war Veterans to world-class primary and more routine care. We are maximizing virtual care capabilities and capacity, and we aim to remain Veterans' provider of choice.\"</p>\n\n<p>U.S. Rep Bill Johnson of Ohio, a 26-year Air Force Veteran, delivered the keynote address during the dedication ceremony.</p>\n\n<p>\"We live in the best nation on the planet, and the reason that we live in the best nation on the planet is the men and women who served in uniform,\" Johnson said. \"I am just humbled every time I stand in the presence of our military veterans. The people who work at these local clinics are committed to their jobs, and they're committed to doing the very best that they can do for our Veterans.\"</p>\n\n<p>Johnson joined Sonel and Christina Hood, clinic operations director, Dr. Scott Carlos, clinic medical director, Darlene Harrington, Valor Healthcare senior operations director, and Charles R. Thilges, VISN 4 deputy network director, for the ribbon cutting. Veterans were then invited to tour the clinic and talk with staff.</p>\n\n<p>The clinic's innovative layout is designed to support VA's Veteran-centered model of care, Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACTs). Each individualized PACT puts Veterans at the center of their health care and includes a provider, nurses, social workers, pharmacists, dietitians and other clinicians, as necessary. The team-based health care model supports VA's holistic approach that encompasses the whole person and promotes healthy habits to prevent disease.</p>\n\n<p>\"We are now fully implementing the PACT model, where the Veteran is the center of their care team,\" said Valor's Harrington. Valor operates the Belmont clinic and VA Pittsburgh's outpatient clinics in Beaver, Washington and Westmoreland counties in Pennsylvania.</p>\n\n<p>To fully accommodate PACTs, the Belmont clinic's private exam rooms surround a separate clinical area where staff communicate and collaborate with one another. The overall layout enhances privacy and safety and simplifies navigation through the clinic.</p>\n\n<p>Janet Dettra, telehealth coordinator, said the new clinic expanded the number of rooms dedicated solely to telehealth encounters from one to four. A multipurpose room is also available, if needed.</p>\n\n<p>\"The more room we have, the more quality time we can provide to Veterans with their providers,\" said Dettra. \"That makes Veterans very happy, and if we can send them out with a smile, it's all worth it.\"</p>\n\n<p>Telehealth provides patients with access to virtual doctors' office visits with physicians, nurse practitioners, psychiatrists and various other specialists.</p>\n\n<p>Harrington invited Veterans who missed the grand opening to visit the clinic anytime during business hours for more information.</p>\n\n<p>\"We are more than happy to give them a tour and help them,\" Harrington said.</p>\n\n<p>The clinic even has a Belmont County Veterans service officer on site four days a week to help Veterans with enrollment and claims, Harrington said.</p>\n\n<p>The Belmont clinic is open weekdays from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. and closed on weekends. The phone number is the same as at the previous site: 740-695-9321.</p>"

Rahman, stand out for expertly filling critical medical facility roles while fostering a collaborative spirit among staff in caring for Veterans.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Decker, director of Infection Prevention, sees herself as a problem solver.</p>\n\n<p>\"The problems that cause infections are incredibly varied and sometimes challenging,\" said Decker. \"My job involves getting the right people together to help solve these problems.\"</p>\n\n<p>Recent examples include ensuring hand sanitizers are plentiful and optimally located to support hand hygiene; safe disposal of needles and syringes; and developing the safest way to shut down and perform maintenance on an air handler in a patient-care area that is always open.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Rahman, a cardiologist, has been director of the Cardiac Cath Lab for the past six years. He credits his dedicated and skilled team for the lab's success, but he says one other factor plays a big role in that success.</p>\n\n<p>\"The icing on top is the staff's eagerness to help our Veterans,\" said Rahman. \"All hospital environments can be intense and demanding and come with general and specific challenges. But having co-workers whom one can count on makes my job at VA an invaluable opportunity.\"</p>\n\n<p>Decker said she likens her investigative work to that of the fictional private detective Sherlock Holmes or Dr. Gregory House, a fictional doctor who solved medical mysteries on television's \"House\" series.</p>\n\n<p>\"For every issue, there may be layers and layers of additional clues to unravel,\" said Decker. \"The 'aha moment' when it all comes together is very gratifying.\"</p>\n\n<p>Even so, Decker says preventing illness in the first place is even more gratifying.</p>\n\n<p>\"Caring for a single patient and solving that one patient's illness is our honor and privilege as health care providers,\" said Decker. \"Preventing 10 patients from getting sick is even better, and that's what we strive to do in Infection Prevention.\"</p>\n\n<p>Rahman said he's been fascinated since childhood with how the human body works.</p>\n\n<p>\"I would read all kinds of articles about new discoveries in medicine and I found myself being drawn more and more toward what is literally the 'heart' of our bodies,\" he said. \"Cardiology is not just a career choice, but a calling, and I think it found me.\"</p>\n\n<p>Both doctors said the best part of working at VA is listening to Veterans' stories.</p>\n\n<p>\"I love sitting down at the bedside and hearing about someone's family, pets, adventures,\" said Decker. \"I've met some truly great people working at VA.\"</p>\n\n<p>Rahman said Veterans' stories make every day at work interesting.</p>\n\n<p>\"As I interact with my patients, I get to hear a lot of fascinating stories of their experiences all over the world,\" said Rahman. \"It's never a dull day at work.\"</p>\n\n<p>Decker and Rahman were formally recognized as Outstanding Physicians of the Year on April 26 during the medical staff's quarterly meeting at University Drive.</p>"

          "processed": "<p>While that is an amazing fact, it is a small number compared to the more than 70,000* people in the U.S. who died from drug overdoses in 2017. Naloxone may have helped to save lives in many of those cases.<br /><br />\nAlso known by the brand name Narcan, naloxone is a medication with the potential to reverse opioid overdoses. It is sometimes prescribed by VA Pittsburgh's Opioid Use Review (OUR) Clinic.<br /><br />\nPrimary Care Chief Dr. Walter Clark, who is certified in addiction medicine, and two doctors of pharmacy started the clinic in 2017. The clinic helps other VA providers care for Veterans whose prescribed opioid use meets specific criteria. That criteria, Clark said, includes: \"Any veteran on an opioid regimen for whom there is even the slightest concern. Any veteran who has not been fully evaluated in a standard manner as advised by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense clinical guidelines for chronic (long-term) opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer pain.\" <br /><br />\nVeterans on long-term opioid therapy who are newly enrolled or haven't been seen at VA in a while should also be evaluated in accordance with the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA), Clark said. <br /><br />\nSigned into law by Congress, CARA was introduced by Congress in 2016 in response to the U.S. opioid epidemic. The law addresses education, intervention, prevention and expanded access to naloxone. <br /><br />\nDuring a one-time, hourlong session, OUR clinic staff talk with Veterans about their pain, discuss ways to improve quality of life and provide opioid safety education. Veterans speak with Clark and a pharmacist either in person in Pittsburgh or via telehealth at regional VA outpatient clinics. <br /><br />\nAccording to pharmacist Amy Plumley, many Veterans are concerned VA will take away their opiates. <br /><br />\n\"It's a review clinic,\" Plumley said. \"It may be totally appropriate for them to be on what they're on. But we know for some patients, keeping them on these medications is potentially dangerous.\"<br /><br />\nVA providers often point Veterans in this category toward additional alternative therapies, including acupuncture and yoga, and more intensive therapies, like VA Pittsburgh's 12-week <a href=\"https://www.post-gazette.com/business/healthcare-business/2016/07/25/VA-offers-alternative-to-opioid-pain-management/stories/201607190172\">Interdisciplinary Pain Rehabilitation Program</a>. <br /><br />\nPlumley said the OUR clinic uses quality of life assessments to see how each Veteran's pain/medication affects their activities. <br /><br />\n\"What are their goals? Are they trying to run a marathon? Or do they just want to play with their grandkids?\" Plumley said. <br /><br />\nSome Veterans want to be on the least amount of medication possible so they can do basic chores and hobbies, like car repairs or cutting the grass, said Beth Desanzo, the other clinic pharmacist.<br /><br />\n\"They want to be able to hunt and fish,\" Desanzo said. \"Maybe their hunting goal is not going to do a full deer drive like they did when they were 20. Maybe it's getting from the truck over to the tree stand.\" <br /><br />\nSafety considerations, like whether the Veteran is using drugs and alcohol, and other factors also come to light during sessions.<br /><br />\n\"We know things can get into the wrong hands. With Narcan, if you are in a situation where you can use this on someone else to save their life, do so,\" Plumley stressed. \"We do have Veterans with grandkids or nieces or nephews who have a drug abuse problem, and the Veteran is concerned about that. We'll replace it if they use it on someone else.\" <br /><br />\nBoth Plumley and Desanzo said they believe the clinic can be easily replicated at other VA health care systems nationwide.<br /><br /><em>*Naloxone rescue data provided by VA Pittsburgh's Center for the Treatment of Addictive Disorders. National overdose death data is from the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/statedeaths.html\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</em><br /><br /><em>Writer's notes: The most commonly used opioids at VA Pittsburgh include codeine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine and oxycodone. Veterans who are prescribed naloxone by any VA Pittsburgh provider must complete training on safely using the device.</em></p>"

          "processed": "<p>Twelve apprentices from the Carpenters Training Center in Pittsburgh installed a platform for the Lionel train display Nov. 28. The platform, which wraps around the base of the grand staircase in building 71, was constructed off-site at the training center over the past several months and has craftmanship from more than 40 apprentices. <br /><br />\n\"When I heard about it, I made sure I tried to volunteer for it,\" said Navy Veteran John Stubenraugh, a commercial carpentry apprentice. \"It's always nice to come back and be able to do something for fellow Veterans.\"<br /><br />\nStubenraugh is one of three Veterans working on the installation, which will include trains, scenery and ceramic houses created by Veterans who reside at Heinz. <br /><br />\n\"When this work was brought up (to the students), we heard 'I'd like to go to that.' There were a lot of volunteers for the project,\" said Rich Paganie, an instructor at the center, which operates under the auspices of Keystone Mountain Lakes (KML) Regional Council of Carpenters. <br /><br />\nThe project, Paganie said, was welcomed with enthusiasm by his students. He credited them for stepping up and showing leadership qualities during the work.<br /><br />\nThe platform construction and installation extends KML's volunteer service to Veterans. For the past three years, KML apprentices and journeymen have installed exterior Christmas decorations at the Heinz campus.<br /><br />\nThe train display will be permanent. Seasonal and holiday variations are expected, according to Ed Connell, American Legion Post 145, Crafton, who will set up the trains in the coming weeks. <br /><br />\nThe project got moving, Connell said, after VA Pittsburgh staff members attended construction safety training at the carpenters' center. Through conversations, design and planning, the two organizations created both a new home for the trains and a learning and service project for students.<br /><br />\nThe set belongs to VA Pittsburgh and has been in storage since major construction at Heinz more than 10 years ago. Before then, Connell said, it was displayed during the holidays in the old ceramics studio. Pieces for the train set were donated by many organizations and volunteers over many years, he said. Connell is an Air Force Veteran and has volunteered at VA Pittsburgh for more than 25 years.<br /><br />\n\"I've been after the VA to resurrect this to pay homage to our Veterans. When (the carpenters) came on board it blossomed, it was just simply fantastic to get it all done like this,\" Connell said. \"It's going to be a win-win situation for the Veterans and the VA. People come in here and see this and know that their loved ones had a part in this. It's simply amazing.\" </p>"
