However, you’re <strong>not </strong>allowed to do general visitation by going from bed to bed, ward to ward, or unit to unit.　</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bringing food</strong><br />\nYou may bring small amounts of candy, fruit, and other food items if the nursing staff says they are appropriate for a patient's diet. You may not bring fresh fruit and flowers to patients who are receiving critical care, and you can’t eat or drink in those units.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Washing hands</strong><br />\nYou must follow hand-hygiene policy guidelines, which require you to practice good hand hygiene when you enter and exit patient rooms, and at other times as directed by staff.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Following infection-control guidelines</strong><br />\nYou must follow guidelines on infection-control signs and report to the nurses' station for instructions before you enter a patient's room.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Staying home if you are ill</strong><br />\nIf you have a communicable disease, you won't be allowed to visit patients inside the medical center.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Prohibited items</strong><br />\nYou're not allowed to bring weapons, cameras, or other prohibited items into the medical center, except when you're conducting official business authorized by the Director or their designee. If you have questions about what qualifies as official business, please contact the facility's Director.　</p>\n\n<p><strong>Giving privacy</strong><br />\nOur staff may ask you to leave the room when they’re caring for patients. If a staff member asks you to leave a patient's room, you may continue your visit in the day room, waiting area, or any other public area of the facility.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Visiting seriously ill patients</strong><br />\nRelatives and friends may visit patients who are seriously ill or in hospice care at any time of day, unless the staff doctor says no.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Visiting patients in restraints</strong><br />\nIn general, you won't be allowed to visit patients who are in restraints. If the treatment team decides that your visit could have a positive effect on the patient, then you may have a supervised visit with the patient when a staff member removes the restraints. Our staff will document how the patient responds to you and other visitors.　</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bringing children to visit</strong><br />\nChildren of all ages can visit patients at our medical center. For infection-control and safety reasons, however, children under the age of 16 are not allowed to visit certain specialty-care units. . All children under the age of 16 must be directly supervised by an adult. Children's bedside visits are limited to 15 minutes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Visiting psychiatric units with children</strong><br />\nChildren under the age of 16 may visit patients in psychiatric units with the doctor’s permission.</p>"
