As always, the safety of our patients and employees is our top priority. Thank you for your patience as we adjust our policies as necessary to allow us to continue to provide safe care.</p>\n\n<h3>COVID-19 TESTING</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Call before reporting for testing</strong></p>\n\n<p>COVID-19 testing is by appointment only. If you have a sore throat, dry cough, shortness of breath or fever, call 412-360-6000 and select option #3 to speak to a nurse before visiting our facilities or to schedule an appointment for drive-through testing at University Drive. Do not report to the Emergency Department just for a test. Do not report for testing without an appointment. If you are having a medical emergency, call 911.</p>\n\n<h3>ENTRY INFORMATION</h3>\n\n<p><strong>All entrants should know we:</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li>Screen all patients, visitors, support persons, and employees at entrances.</li>\n</ul><ul><li>Require everyone in our facilities to wear a face covering or mask when within 6 feet of another person. Bring your own or we will provide one. Please see CDC’s recommendations for cloth face masks. We will make an exception only for Veterans who have a documented medical condition that prevents them from wearing a face covering or mask. Other entrants who do not agree to wear a face covering or mask will not be admitted to our facilities.</li>\n</ul><ul><li>Eliminated valet services at the University Drive campus. Veteran parking has been expanded and personnel are available to assist patients to appointments, as needed.</li>\n</ul><h3><strong>VISITATION RESTRICTIONS</strong></h3>\n\n<p><strong>Emergency Department</strong></p>\n\n<p>No visitors are permitted in Emergency Department waiting areas. Clinical staff or the charge nurse may grant exceptions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Inpatient Visitation</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li>For patients who are not COVID-positive, visitation on all units except Behavioral Health and the Community Living Center (CLC) is limited to one visitor per patient daily between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. Visitors must pass COVID-19 screening.</li>\n\t<li>COVID-19 positive patients cannot receive in-person visitors unless they are near end of life. We will arrange in-person visitation for a maximum of two visitors daily for COVID-positive patients near end of life.

For all other COVID-positive patients, we will arrange visits by phone and Facetime, Skype, Zoom, etc.</li>\n\t<li>Visitation on the Behavioral Health unit is by appointment only between 1 and 2 p.m. and 6 and 7:30 p.m. Call the unit to arrange a visit.</li>\n\t<li>The CLC currently offers virtual visits by phone, Facetime, Skype, Zoom etc., or contact-free, in-person visits by appointment only.
