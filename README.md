# VA.gov Content Build [![Build Status](https://dev.vets.gov/jenkins/buildStatus/icon?job=testing/content-build/master)](http://jenkins.vetsgov-internal/job/testing/job/content-build/job/master/)

## What is this?

This repository contains scripts and templates which generate static HTML pages for the VA.gov site.

There are several repositories that contain the code and content used to build VA.gov. If you're looking to get started running VA.gov locally, you should read the [Getting Started](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/veteran-facing-services-tools/getting-started) documentation.

## Common commands

Once you have the site set up locally, these are some common commands you might find useful:

| I want to...                                  | Then you should...                                                           |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| fetch all dependencies                        | `yarn install`. Run this any time `package.json` changes                     |
| build static HTML pages                       | `yarn build`                                                                 |
| run the dev server                            | `yarn serve`. Uses port 3002, keeping 3001 free for vets-website dev server  |
| watch for template changes                    | `yarn watch`. Runs the dev server while watching for changes                 |

### Building static content

VA.gov contains many pages that include content generated from a Drupal-based content model.
When testing changes to static pages, or to see what your application looks like
on VA.gov, you'll need to build these static pages using the following commands:

`yarn build` (fetches the latest content cache from S3 by default when cache is empty)

- use `--pull-drupal` to fetch fresh content from Drupal if needed (requires SOCKS proxy access)
- creates symlink to `../vets-website/build/localhost/generated` by default, allowing access to app bundles (use `--apps-directory-name` to change the default apps directory name; e.g. `--apps-directory-name application`)
- run once to build the static HTML files
- need to run this again when adding new templates based on new Drupal entities

`yarn serve`

- starts a local server for the site using the latest build
- use `--port` to set the port for the server (`3002` by default)
- use `--buildtype` to set the build type (`localhost` by default)

`yarn watch`

- watches for changes to liquid templates

`yarn preview`

- You can run this concurrently with `yarn watch`. It adds local routes needed to preview Drupal nodes
  (e.g. `/preview?nodeId=XX`).

If you do not have access to the SOCKS proxy, you can **fetch the latest cached version
of the content** with the following:

```sh
yarn fetch-drupal-cache
```
## Running tests

### Unit tests

To **run all unit tests,** use:

```sh
yarn test:unit
```

If you want to **run only one test file**, you can provide the path to it:

```sh
yarn test:unit src/site/filters/liquid.unit.spec.js
```

To **run all tests in a directory**, you can use a glob pattern:

```sh
yarn test:unit src/site/filters/**/*.spec.js
```

## More commands

After a while, you may run into a less common task. We have a lot of commands
for doing very specific things.
